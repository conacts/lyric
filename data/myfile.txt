I'm tryna do it all tonight I got plans

I got a certain lust for life and as it stands

Everything is going as right as it can

They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands before it lands

But you could miss me with all that

Diss me then crawl back

I really wish y'all would fall back

But gettin' rich s'posed to solve that

And these days women make offers

And who the hell am I to say No no no

My ex sendin' late night texts

'Cause she don't know how to let Go go go

Uh she in love

And as for them pretty lightskinned models

Standin' in the cold ah yeah they with us

Let them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear

Sayin' she should be the one I see every time that I'm here

But when am I really even here

Black Suburban with the tint on it

Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it

The game got these old handprints on it

But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it

Uh and start over

And show up in a Margiela tux I don't really give a fuck

And we're only gettin' older

So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past

It's funny when you're comin' in first but you hope that you're last

You just hope that it lasts



Throw your ones up in the air

Throw your ones up in the air for her ohoh

Throw your ones up in the air

Throw your ones up



Hey there pretty girl

You know exactly what you got

And I don't blame you at all

You can't resist it

Especially when the light's so bright

And the money's so right

And it's comin' in every single night

She don't wanna leave

She just stuck in

And she dance to the song

And she dance to the song

And it go Hey now now watch her go down

Oh oh oh



She doesn't ever worry

If she wants it she'll get it on her own

She knows there's more to life

And she's scared of ending up alone



Throw your ones up in the air

Throw your ones up in the air for her

Throw your ones up in the air

'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of



Houstatlantavegas Ayy Houstatlantavegas Ayy

And it go Hey now now watch her go down

Oh oh



We all got dreams and we all starreachin'

All starpeakin' allstar weekend

One hotel room that all y'all sleep in

Housekeeper knock to see if all y'all decent

Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'

Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'

You be at the games lookin' right all season

But you always with me on the night y'all leavin'

Ask Lo ask Lo I always request you

You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue

Carry you inside get you some water and undress you

I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who

Or why or how or when

Tonight it's prolly 'bout to happen all over again

And she live in a mindset that I could never move to

Until you find yourself it's impossible to lose you

Uh because I never had you although I would be glad to

I'd probably go and tattoo your name on my heart

I swear I start to think that I'm going crazy



Throw your ones up in the air

Throw your ones up in the air for her

Throw your ones up in the air

'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Just enough to solve your problems too much'll kill ya

And when I leave I always come right back here

The young spitter that everybody in rap fear

A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year

The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier

Nickels for my thoughts dimes in my bed

Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head

Take my verses too serious you'll hate me

'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD

Yeah I want it all that's why I strive for it

Diss me you'll never hear a reply for it

Any award show or party I get fly for it

I know that it's comin' I just hope that I'm alive for it

Cars and the clothes Clothes the hoes

Yeah I want things to go my way

But as of late a lot of shit been goin' sideways

And my mother tried to run away from home

But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway

And she cried to me so I cried too

And my stomach was soakin' wet she only '

And  that was all before I showed up

And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up

Damn my reality just set in

And even when the Phantom's leased them hoes wanna get in

I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in

So tryna keep up with my progress it's like a deadend

My girl love me but fuck it my heart beats slow

And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show

And life change for us every single week so

It's good but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the

Wise words from a decent man

Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand

This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan

And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man

Inperson I am everything and more

I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before

But inside I'm treadin' water steady tryna swim to shore

I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store

Yeah just call me Shoppin' Bag Drizzy

Or call me Mr Damn he ain't coppin' that is he

And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy

While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy

I'ma kill it I promise that's how I know you're mad

I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads

The big homie use a flash if you must

And I swear I ain't askin' for much all I want is the



Yeah I want the money Money money and the cars

Cars and the clothes Clothes the hoes

I just wanna be I just wanna be successful



Yeah it's like I it's like I know what I gotta say

I just don't know how to say it to you



Uh pardon the swag but bitch it's Cartey

Long bread I don't eat shortcake how come I can't

Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates

Cheese but she's not in this portrait

And yeah life's fine but I don't portray

I'm on the other side but it is a short gate

I don't want the glow I want the gloray

And I'ma fuck the world but this is just foreplay

Tired of hearin' bullshit bring on the cow shit

Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit

And that's word to Toronto

So high up I got birds in the condo

Ha ain't that a female dog

Ask her who I am to her and she yell God

Weezy Baby I go real hard

No further details boy



Uh when did you get like this

Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning

I don't regret like this

So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning

Saying This just ain't my style

You can't say you're happy either

You don't even smile for me no



Did you agree we should let it be

And did you agree it's a must

Let's call the whole thing off

We just have had enough of us

Let's call the whole thing off

We just have had enough of us



When you decided to knock on my door

Did you remember what happened before

The look on your face said you were expecting more

But some things look better inside of the store



Did you agree we should let it be

And did you agree it's a must

Let's call the whole thing off

We just have had enough of us

Let's call the whole thing off

We just have had enough of us



Look leave me leave me I can't fucking stand you

Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to

My girlfriend my girlfriend call herself my girlfriend

Tell me that we 'posed to be together 'til the world end

But I don't really feel that

I just really wanna turn the wheels back

Give you all your sweaters and your heels back

Convince you that time will heal that

Uh you look for reasons for us to argue

I swear every time I call you just tell me how I don't call you

Why you do that Do that do that yeah



Did you agree we should let it be

One time for the homie DJ Screw

Already I'm feeling throwed in this bitch



Up so high even when I'm coming down

Just met a girl say she from the HTown

I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer

Cup inside a cup smoking Ghostface Killah

Got these boppas going crazy nigga I'm the man

I sent ya girl a message said I'll see ya when I can

She sent me one back but I ain't never read it

'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it



And I'm telling you I'm as cold as windows down in the winter

And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner

Airport stunting flying charters overseas

Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's

Don't know why it happens every time we alone

But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone

So I'ma sip this drank until that motherfuker gone

And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on



I don't give you the time you deserve from me

This is something I know I know I know

So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston

Taking everything slow so slow so slow

But I do it to her



Draped up dripped out know what I'm talking 'bout

 in the morning get it popping in the parking lot

It's on once again and I never pretend

A nigga staying G 'til the end



Ayy yeah

I swear like every time we find ourselves in this situation you know

I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston

Candy paint switching colors in the light

It's about like  PM and you just rolling through the city

Bumping that Screw Big Moe UGK Lil' Keke

It feel like like everything's just moving slow

Let's take my time I pace it baby yeah I'm gone



Yeah I appreciate your patience tonight

It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking

I find nowadays it's you know best to keep quiet

But uh sometimes you just gotta let it out

Young Angel and Young Lion you know what it is



Uh look I'm the property of October

I ain't drive here I got chauffeured

Bring me champagne flutes ros and some shots over

I think better when I'm not sober

I smoke goodie no glaucoma I'm a stockholder

Private flights back home no stop over

Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over

The shit my mother look shocked over

Yeah but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven

A migraine take two Excedrin

I'm the one twice over I'm the new eleven

And if I die I'ma do it reppin' I never do a second

I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard

And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars

Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours

'Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star

I done became bigger swervin' writin' in my peers' lane

Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name

One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change

And show me the city that I without fear claim

What I set seems to never extinguish

Coolest kid out baby word to Chuck Inglish

Count my own money see the paper cut fingers

My song is your girlfriend's wakingup ringer

Heh or alarm or whatever

She be here at six in the morn' if I let her

But I never get attracted to fans

'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam

I always knew that I could figure

How to get these label heads to offer him good figures

And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous

'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas

It's all good I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over

Make pasta rent a movie call hoes over

Rest in peace to Heath Ledger but I'm no joker

I'll slow roast ya got no holster

Wet glass on your table nigga no coaster

Burn bread everyday boy no toaster

G and Tez got a SIG but I'm no smoker

They just handin' chips to me nigga no poker

I'm with it Young Money Cash Money soldier

My cup runneth over

The same niggas I ball with I fall with

On some southern drawl shit

Rookie of the year ' Chris Paul shit

DR CJ and Po I see y'all

These cases don't work out I hope we can agree on

Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off

First thing I'ma do is free Weezy go



And I'd take probation

I don't want that TI and Vick vacation

Private plane pick location

I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation

Yeah I don't stunt I stunt hard

And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it

But in the meantime you can call me young Roy

Jones Jr fightin' the drugs and gun charge

Shit don't leave me unguarded

And I'm a cheesehead word to Vince Lombardi

Word to Marky Mark leave a snitch departed

All that blood like the Red Sea parted

My gun go crazy like it's retarded

Red light on it like it's recording

I ain't recordin' I'm just Cin'

My currency foreign we are in a league they aren't

Better dig in your pocket and pay homage

Better cover your eyes your face fallin'

Watch the game from the side I'm play callin'

No I didn't say that I'm flawless

But I damn sure don't tarnish

My pistol got comments for your garments

I'm so high I can vomit on a comet

KY no homo I'm on it

Weezy F Baby new born bitch

You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch

I'm gon' get money money I'm gon' get

Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit

And get that toilet paper quick like when Bones spit

And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit

Motherfucker I'm me Yeah bitch I'm me

You niggas sweet like the pussy in which I eat

Fireman burn down your entire street

So fly I'ma take off when I leap

Bye And you can suck my wings

Stand on my money headbutt Yao Ming

Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things

I'm shufflin' the cards 'bout to cut my queens

But I ain't the dealer

House full of bitches like Tila Tequila

Yeah I'm the man in the mirror

My swagger just screamin' motherfucker do you hear her

Yeah Drizzy Drake what the lick read

We make magic boy Roy and Siegfried



Woo Young Mula baby

Yeah



Spending every moment in the studio

I never said it'd be fair

But when you're all alone I hope you truly know

How bad I want to be there



Come right in set your bag down

Took a night off for you

Go ahead and turn the lights off

But keep your heels on

They're fittin' for what I'm about to do oh

Know you hate explaining how you want it done

Just be quiet I'll do fine without your help girl

Can you work without a second for some fun

Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl

And I know what to do with it

I know what to do with it

I know what to do with it

I know what to do with it



I been waiting for so long to get you all alone

Now I finally got you right here

So baby I'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone

'Cause I wanna make one thing clear

I want you on top so let your hair down

I took the night off for you

Girl I'm gonna turn the lights off but keep your heels on

They're fittin' for what we're about to do



Come right in set your bag down

I took a night off for you

Go ahead and turn the lights off

But keep your heels on

They're fittin' for what I'm about to do oh

Know you hate explaining how you want it done

Just be quiet I'll do fine without your help girl

Can you work without a second for some fun

Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl

And I know what to do with it

I know what to do with it

I know what to do with it

I know what to do with it



Oh it's  o'clock in the morning at the studio



Why do I feel so alone

Like everybody passing through the studio

Is in character as if he acting out a movie role

Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know

And I don't have the heart

To give these bitch niggas the cue to go

So they stick around kicking out feedback

And I entertain it as if I need that

I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that

My privacy about the only thing I need back but

It's hard to think of them polite flows

When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes

And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes

And you still make it even when they say your flight closed

Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows

Life was so full now this shit just being lipo'd

Always said I'd say it all on the right track

But in this game you only lose when you fight back

Black diamond bracelets showing you the basics

I can't live and hold the camera someone gotta tape this

And make hits like a bitch that's married I ain't miss

 hours from greatness I'm that close

Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt

Transitioning from fitting in to standing out

Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South

Watchin' Hov's show embarrassed to pull my camera out

And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out

So I park about five houses down

She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown

But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around

So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus

But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness

Got niggas reactin' without a sinus

'Cause what I'm working with is timeless

And promoters try to get me out to they club

And say I have fun but I can't imagine how

'Cause I just seen my exgirl standing with my next girl

Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now

And shit could get weird unless they all down

And so I stay clear we from a small town

And everybody talks and everybody listen

And somehow the truth just always comes up missing

I've always been something that these labels can't buy

Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul

And Sylvia be tellin' Tez Damn Drake fly

And he just be like Silly motherfucker I know

That was your bad how could you pass up on 'em

He just take them records and he gas up on 'em

Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em

Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em

Oh they did Po at least they tried to

And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you

But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video

And they think they can market you however they decide to

Nah but  told me to do me

And don't listen to anybody that knew me

'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me

And if you think I changed in the slightest coulda fooled me

Boy and to my city I'm the 

Drug dealers live vicariously through me

I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy

I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy

Understand I could get money with my eyes closed

Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo

So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll

Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know

'Cause they need it much more than I ever will

I got new shit I'm gettin' better still

Little niggas put my name in they verses

'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal

Future said 'Cause this 'Ye shit you better kill

And I think this got this makingofaLegend feel

Problem with these other niggas they ain't never real



Yeah that's all I can say



Hands down I'm too proud for love

But with eyes shut it's you I'm thinkin' of

But how we move from A to B it can't be up to me

'Cause you don't know who I was before you

And basically to see a change in me

I'd be losing so I just ignore you yeah

Oh but you're on my mind my mind my mind my mind my mind

Oh but maybe in time in time in time I'll tell you I'm



A little bit a little bit

A little bit in love with you

I guess that I'm a little bit a little bit

A little bit in love with you



I know you told me break their hearts

But it's you I wanna take apart

And I will never ever be the first to say it

But still I they know I

I would do it push a button

Pull a trigger climb a mountain

Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby

I love you love you a little bit

I would do it you would say it

You would mean it we could do it

It was you and I and only I mm



I think I'm a little bit little bit

A little bit in love with you

But only if you're a little bit

Little bit in love with me



I hope they never find out

What they already know know know

As soon as it's official

We'll have to let it go go go

So we don't confirm the fling

Keep avoiding all the questions

You could teach me many things

I'm just scared to learn a lesson

The pressure's on both hearts beat like a metronome

Both in sync like a Justin song

Feels so right but it's just so wrong

I wonder where my world 'bout

When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out

And her friends say I ain't the one to go for

She just jealous 'cause you always get approached more

Oh well tell her fall back

Caught up in some more shit tell her call back

Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass

Wit a girl that I know yeah tell her all that that

And as for you I think I know you're the one

The closest I've come I'm probably a



A little bit a little bit

A little bit in love with you

I guess that I'm a little bit a little bit

A little bit in love with you oh

Oh oh



My name is Drizzy and I ain't perfect

But I work hard so I deserve it

And I belong right where you see me

Ain't on the fence about it I ain't Mr Feeny

Nah I got a decent set of manners

And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner

And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour

Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana

So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it

But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it

You could show up at the party on dirty public transit

And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids

Of you and your posse partyin' drinkin' what you get handed

With your Virgin Island tans all lookin' like you just landed

I don't really understand it I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'

But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin' screamin'



I got to be unstoppable

Ahem my name is Weezy I'm almost perfect

And I work harder than hard workin'

Bizarre circus that's when my bars surface

Therefore I act a clown

Even when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down

So overstand me

I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy

And I run Louisiana but I've never pulled a hammy

And I got a condo in Atlanta and I always wear a bandanna

And when it comes down to stuntin' you boys are just buntin'

And I'm swingin' for the fence your girl hangin' from my dick

Your girl singin' to my shit like alalalollipop

She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop

And she say I freak that pussy better

Better than her gynecologist ho just

Text me whenever you want some more dick

More dick old bitch young bitch

But I be like damn all I got is one dick

Ayayayay you don't lie

Bun B king of the trill also one of the dopest

Whether the streets or on the mic I'm dope and yes I'm focused

The gangster recognize me for my locness no joke it's

Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust

Or maybe like a python that's the type of shit I'm on

I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this iBomb

I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight

From the freethrow line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike

Bun and Wayne and Drake in here mane this gon' be a great night

Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white

Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right

Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night

This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long

The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song

UGK and Young Money too strong

I will realize you were everything I'm missing

And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

The girl or the world You see someone gotta lose

I thought that I could have it all do I really gotta choose

What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time

And what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind

Night's fallin' lights glowing

And I'm just trying to pay the price owing

And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing

And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments

Nigga nice going is it worth it That decision

'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision

So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants

All alone when I am gone

I just wanna keep you warm

Yes I'll be there yeah yes I'll be there

Uh

I'm just so far gone

October's own

Please leave me alone

Drunk off champagne

Screamin' in the phone

See my house is not a home

Fuck is going on

Where did we go wrong

Where do we belong

Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone

Meanin' if it rains I'm the one it's rainin' on

When my diamond chain is on still nothin' set in stone

Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne

And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't

Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known

To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone

Places we get flown parties that we've thrown

I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown

It's only been three years

Look at how I've grown

I'm just in my zone

I call this shit the calm

Yeah but I'm the furthest thing from calm

Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond

Everything will be OK and it won't even take that long

You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm

Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known

I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne

I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't 'cause



You know everything gon' be alright I promise

I apologize to you know put y'all in this position vent to y'all but

 Mama always say don't ask permission

Just ask forgiveness you know so uh forgive me yeah yeah

Say



Uh

And life is so insane

Look what I became trying to make a name

All my first dates are interrupted by my fame

Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain

They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain

It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain

Women need attention therefore women will complain

Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame

Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game

I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne

It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing

So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain

Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange

'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed

Like how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range

And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change

Damn and I can only feel his pain

'Cause in Memphis Tennessee there's only so much to attain

So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again

He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain

I'm why your girl heart is in a sling

Call me Heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame

As a man I'm just honest as an artist I'm a king

With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain

Yeah and see this is the thang

What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain

The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane

Is the singlehanded reason I remain me yeah



Uh

I said I call this shit the calm

But I'm the furthest thing from calm

Swear I'm putting on

But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on like

Man



This here is on some truthful shit

It seems like everything I do you're used to it

And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with

That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside

So you still think I'm confident and damn

Is this gonna last

You're up on a pedestal are we moving too fast

Feels like I'm in crazy competition with the past

That's why I gotta ask



Is anything I'm doin' brandnew

Brandnew brandnew brandnew brandnew brandnew

Is anything I'm doin' brandnew

Is anything I'm doin' brandnew

Brandnew brandnew brandnew brandnew brandnew

Oh girl Ayy ayy ayy



This here is something personal

I highly doubt this feeling is reversible

Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know

That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside

So I don't ever question you and damn

I can't even find the perfect brush

So I can paint what's going through my mind

Racing against myself but I'm a couple steps behind

That's why I gotta ask



Is anything I'm doin' brandnew

Brandnew brandnew brandnew brandnew brandnew

Is anything I'm doin' brandnew

Is anything I'm doin' brandnew

Brandnew brandnew brandnew brandnew brandnew

Oh girl Ayy ayy ayy

Is anything I'm doin' brandnew

New new new new new

Or is everything I'm doing too late

Late late late late



Did he take your clothes off just like this

Did he give you loving just like this

Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date

Tell me baby am I too late



Is anything I'm doin' brandnew

Brandnew brandnew brandnew brandnew brandnew

Show me if this is brandnew brandnew

Is anything I'm doin' brandnew

New new new brandnew oh yeah yeah yeah



Uh black hearts on my cardigan

At the crib telling ya girl that we should orderin

Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman

We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than

Damn I'm so Catriona smarter than

A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in

Yeah and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things

I float high don't try and cut my water wings

I'm still myself

Suicide bars I kill myself

Charge it to the game I bill myself

And I don't feel y'all but I feel myself

Aunty Doe tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov

I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off

I'm next to blow pause

And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause

Yeah I tried to tell 'em Future let 'em know

Send the haters all my love X and O

I got a black box where suggestions go

But I don't really give a fuck it's prolly best you know

My reality is brighter than your dreams are

I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car

Yeah and the visual is stunnin'

I hope they document what I'm becomin'

Congratulations



So what you want an award or somethin'

I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'

I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing

Put on your poker face I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'

But I ain't with the hard talk

I got a monopoly catch me on my boardwalk

Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark

Just know I'm breakin' world records no false start

I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'

My deal like Weezy first week one point somethin'

And my verses gettin' stupider

Wayne if you're on Mars can you pick me up from Jupiter

Phone blowin' up so I'm cuttin' off my cellular

I'm a superstar noted on to my nebula

I will break a leg break an arm and a fibula

When I break it down when I when I break it down

I hug and kiss the drum kick

I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit

But you could never beat my ass pause

Again dammit y'all again

Y'all pretend that we are some men that get it on and in

I'll die before I lose 'cause I was born to win

If he don't fuck with y'all then don't bother him

And yes I fuck this game but I won't father them

Right uh



It's like these days man I'm booked and I'm busy

Dad named me Drake Footz named me Drizzy

They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege

But if you watched the VMAs there's nothing more to say

I got the key to happiness and all the copies

Remember this day like you bought a poppy

And damn how I get so nice

I just spent it all once 'bout to get rich twice

Surprise party bitch now it's on and poppin'

I always choose dough like it's my only option

'Cause money always knows best

Chain snatch flow they say Get it off your chest

And I'm what all the fuss about

And if they talkin' I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout

Hit me at the office same extension

Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention



Money just changed everything

I wonder how life without it would go

From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow

Looking down from the top and it's crowded below

My fifteen minutes started an hour ago

Truth over fame you know I respect the blatant shit

When I hear 'em talking I just don't know what to make of it

Hate is so familiar to me I'm slowly embracing it

Doesn't come natural bear with me it could take a bit

Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with

But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it

Wayne put me right here that's who I get the paper with

I hope that my success never alters our relationship

Yeah this life is something I would die for

October's Own but it's looking like July 

I just wish they'd let you try it first

This time I'm really going off fireworks



Oh today it begins

I've missed them before

But won't miss them again

I keep having the same dream

And I think that I just realized what it means



All I see is fireworks

All I see is fireworks

Every night it's fireworks

Every night it's fireworks

All I see is fireworks

All I see is fireworks

Taking off like fireworks

Taking off likeOh



I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me

Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery

I could tell it wasn't love I just thought you'd fuck with me

Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me

Damn I kept my wits about me luckily

What happened between us that night It always seems to trouble me

Now all of a sudden these gossip rags want to cover me

And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me

But I was curious

And I'll never forget it baby what an experience

You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious

There was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it

That felt good all in all I learned a lesson from it though

You never see it coming you just get to see it go

Yeah I should've looked up in the sky at first

Now I can see it in her eyes fireworks



Oh today it begins

I've missed them before

But won't miss them again

I keep having the same dream

And I think that I just realized what it means



All I see is fireworks

All I see is fireworks

Every night it's fireworks

Every night it's fireworks

All I see is fireworks

All I see is fireworks

Taking off like fireworks

Taking off likeOh



Everything's the same but it feels different

My dad called me up knowing that I still listen

And he's still got his foot out guilt tripping

It's been years though I just learn to deal with it

For real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport

Got my mother in a place with some better decor

She searched the entire city I let her explore

And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before

How many of our parents marriages lasted

I was only  I bet I barely reacted

I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic

Searching for that feeling tell me where is the magic

Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts

I want to witness love I never seen it close

Yeah but I guess I gotta find it first

That's why I'm really going off fireworks



Oh today it begins

I've missed them before

But won't miss them again

I keep having the same dream

And I think that I just realized what it means



All I see is fireworks

All I see is fireworks

Every night it's fireworks

Every night it's fireworks

All I see is fireworks

All I see is fireworks

Taking off like fireworks

Taking off likeOh



Things have been so crazy and hectic

I should've gotten back by now

But you know how much I wanted to make it

It's probably better anyhow

So if you gotta go

If there's anything I should know

If the spotlight makes you nervous

If you're looking for a purpose



You put the tea in the kettle and light it

Put your hand on the metal and feel it

But do you even feel it anymore

I remember when you thought I was joking

Now I'm off singing karaoke

Further than I've ever been

So if you gotta go

If there's any way I can help



Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner

That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta

Damn of all the places you could go

I just thought you'd choose somewhere

That had somebody that you know

I'm always up too late I worry 'bout you there alone

In that place you call your home warm nights and cold Patron

I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy

Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady

I know they say the first love is the sweetest

But that first cut is the deepest

I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets

Secrets you were telling everybody but me

Don't be fooled by the money I'm still just young and unlucky

I'm surprised you couldn't tell



I was only trying to get ahead

I was only trying to get ahead

But the spotlight makes you nervous

And you're looking for a purpose

I was only trying to get ahead

I was only trying to get ahead

But the spotlight makes you nervous



Uh uh

Young Money

Yeah yeah yeah



I know way too many people here right now

That I didn't know last yearwho the fuck are y'all

I swear it feels like the last few nights

We've been everywhere and back

But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing What am I doing

Oh yeah that's rightI'm doing me I'm doing me

I'm living life right now man

And this what I'ma do 'til it's over 'til it's over

But it's far from over



Alright bottles on me long as someone drink it

Never drop the ball fuck are y'all thinking

Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking

About to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove tell me how I'm getting home

You too fine to be laying down in bed alone

I could teach you how to speak my language Rosetta Stone

I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

About to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas

All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers

Super good smidoke a package of the Swisher's

I did it overnight it couldn't happen any quicker

Y'all know them Well fuck it me either

But point the biggest skeptic out I'll make him a believer

It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwing hundreds

When I should be throwing ones bitch I run it



I know way too many people here right now

That I didn't know last yearwho the fuck are y'all

I swear it feels like the last few nights

We've been everywhere and back

But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing What am I doing

Oh yeah that's rightI'm doing me I'm doing me

I'm living life right now man

And this what I'ma do 'til it's over 'til it's over

But it's far from over



One thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain

And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane

So they tell me that they love me I know better than that it's just game

It's just what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that I'm just saying

But I really can't complain everything is kosher

Two thumbs up Ebert and Roeper

I really can't see the end getting any closer

But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over

So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on

Can you see me Can you see me Get your Visine on

Y'all just do not fit the picture turn your wide screen on

If you thinking I'ma quit before I die dream on

Man they treat me like a legend am I really this cold

I'm really too young to be feeling this old

It's about time you admit it who you kidding

Man nobody's ever done it like I did it uh



I know way too many people here right now

That I didn't know last yearwho the fuck are y'all

I swear it feels like the last few nights

We've been everywhere and back

But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing What am I doing

Oh yeah that's rightI'm doing me I'm doing me

I'm living life right now man

And this what I'ma do 'til it's over 'til it's over

But it's far from over

Yeah that's rightI'm doing me I'm doing me

In the bathroom flat irons and nail files

Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles

In the mall steady racking up the air miles

Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number

You say you droppin'  pounds preparin' for summer

And you don't do it for the man men never notice

You just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest

Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart

I've always liked my women book and street smart

Long as they got a little class like half days

And the confidence to overlook my past ways

Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in

But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in

And look I really think nobody does it better

I love the way that you put it together uh

Now she play these suckers just like BoB play the guitar

Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar

Independent with the demeanor of an RB singer

Naked ring finger M Bimmer

Champagne Range triplewhite Jag

Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags

Alexander McQueen Prada Gucci Chanel

They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out

Baby don't hold on too long cause that's how them stories start out

And all the girls that played me eat your motherfuckin' heart out

It's Drizzy always gone but never hard to find

And since you can't escape me do I ever cross your mind

Because all this shit is new to me I'm learnin' to behave

And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save

But I'm good I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle

I'm lookin' forward to the memories of right now

Never forgettin' from where I came

And no matter where I'm headed I promise to stay the same

I'm just



I'm just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down

'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'

I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to

But party on party on all night nigga

I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars

Storytellers they ain't even need a campfire

Oh just thought you should know



That's when you start to laugh

Saying I just want what I can't have

Won't even give me a chance

Claiming I'm just not as serious as you

Shorty if you only knew this is serious



I wish I wasn't famous

I wish I was still in school

So that I could have you in my dorm room

I would put it on you crazy



That's when you start to laugh

Saying I just want what I can't have

Won't even give me a chance

Claiming I'm just not as serious as you

Shorty if you only knew this is serious



Up all night

Up all night

Up all night

Up all night

Up all night

Up all night

Up all night



I'm more than just an option

Hey hey hey

Refuse to be forgotten

Hey hey hey

I took a chance with my heart

Hey hey hey

And I feel it taking over



I better find your loving I better find your heart

I better find your loving I better find your heart

I better find your loving I better find your heart

I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart



I'm more than just a number

Hey hey hey

I doubt you'll find another

Hey hey hey

So every single summer

Hey hey hey

I'll be the one that you'll remember and



I better find your loving I better find your heart

I better find your loving I better find your heart

I better find your loving I better find your heart

I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart



It's more than just a mission

I better find your loving I better find your heart

I better find your loving I better find your heart

But give all I have to you and



I better find your loving I better find your heart

I better find your loving I better find your heart

I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart



I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart



You could thank me now go 'head

Thank me later yeah I know what I said

But later doesn't always come so instead

It's OK you could thank me now

Yeah

Well alright

Here I go



Uh Mahalo from the hardest act to follow

Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle

Alohas to women with no ties to men

That I know well that way there are no lies

You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas

I'm on the brink of influential I'm here for you niggas

I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas

I must have been hard to watch what a year for you niggas

It's December st and we in Miami just meditating

You got your resolutions we just got reservations

Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up

And we just want to party Patron straight up

Fuck that old shit I'm on new things

OVO Clique Red Wing Boot Gang

Yeah we want it all half was never the agreement

Who would have thought the route we'd chosen

Would ever end up this scenic

I can relate to kids going straight to the league

When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed

And that's around the time

That your idols become your rivals

You make friends with Mike

But got to AI him for your survival

Damn I swear sports and music are so synonymous

'Cause we want to be them and they want to be us

So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment

That you take for granted yyou can thank me now

And oh my goodness you're welcome you're welcome

At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from

Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them

'Cause they think that I can help them

Get back to where they fell from

But drink up 'cause everyone here is good tonight

Except the niggas that I came with they good for life

That's how you know it's going down

In case another chance never comes around



Yyou could thank me now Thank me now go 'head

Thank me later yeah I know what I said

But later doesn't always come so instead

It's OK you could thank me now You you you



Uh shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming

I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women

I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it

'Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic

Man the good girls went silent on me

They got a boyfriend or left for college on me

And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now

That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me

But do I ever come up in discussion

Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins

Do I Or is missing what we had out of the question

I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson

I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes

Who was there before it all I guess that's how it goes

They hear about your cons but focus on your pros

And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul

But those same ones from your area will grow into women

That are ready to get married at Hello

Because of what they allowed where are they all now

I know they're somewhere watching

So I'm trying to make them proud

Searching for the meaning you'll find it next to me

They tell me I'm the hottest guess we finally get to see

I'm feeling like Nas who am I to disagree

They say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key

That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining

Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment

I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded

And the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it

I'm sorry

Poolside drinking Margarita rounds

Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town

I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown

And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down

I'm in a world where things are taken never given

How long they choose to love you will never be your decision

And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen

So while I'm still here in this position



Yyou could thank me now Thank me now go 'head Go 'head

Thank me later yeah I know what I said What I said

But later doesn't always come so instead

It's OK you could thank me now

It's a OK OK



It may not mean nothin' to y'all

But understand nothin' was done for me

So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I want this shit forever mane ever mane ever mane

I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall

And tellin' every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even plannin' to call

I want this shit forever mane ever mane ever mane



Last name Ever first name Greatest

Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nothin' to play with

Started off local but thanks to all the haters

I know GIV pilots on a first name basis

In your city faded off the brown Nino

She insist she got more class we know

Swimmin' in the money come and find me Nemo

If I was at the club you know I balled chemo

Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album

Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome

Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm

Everybody got a deal I did it without one

Yeah nigga I'm about my business

Killin' all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list

Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness

If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness bitches



It may not mean nothin' to y'all

But understand nothin' was done for me

So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I want this shit forever mane ever mane ever mane

I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall

And tellin' every girl she the one for me

Everever Mr West is in the buildin'

Ain't no question who about to kill 'em

I used to have hood dreams big fame big chains

I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came

And went hard all fall like the ball teams

Just so I can make it rain all spring

Y'all seen my story my glory

I had raped the game young you can call it statutory

When a nigga blow up they're gonna build statues for me

Old money Benjamin Button What nothin'

Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin

You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband

You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't

Like they was down with the old me no you fuckin' wasn't

Um you're such a fuckin' loser

He ain't even go to class Bueller

Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back

Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack

Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac

All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act

They pull the cameras out and goddamn he snap

I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back



It may not mean nothin' to y'all

But understand nothin' was done for me

So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I want this shit forever mane ever mane ever mane

I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall

And tellin' every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even plannin' to call

I want this shit forever mane ever mane ever mane



Okay hello it's the Martian Space Jam Jordans

I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden

Fresher than the harvest step up to the target

If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans

And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops

Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur To the top

Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster then it drops

But what should I scream for This is my theme park

My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark

Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk

Let the king talk check the price and pay attention

Lil Wayne that's what they gotta say or mention

I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer

I'm restin' in the lead I need a pillow and a cover

Shh my foot's sleepin' on the gas

No brake pads no such thing as last uh



It may not mean nothin' to y'all

But understand nothin' was done for me

So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I want this shit forever mane ever mane ever mane

I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall

And tellin' every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even plannin' to call

I want this shit forever mane ever mane ever mane



There they go packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow

Nuts they go Macadamian they go so ballistic whoa

He can make them look like bozos

He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow fuck no

Go for broke his cup just runneth over oh no

He ain't had him a buzz like this

Since the last time that he overdosed

They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose

Back into the game and they know

Rap will never be the same as before

Bashin' in the brains of these hoes

And establishin' a name as he goes

The passion in the flame is ignited

You can't put it out once we light it

This shit is exactly what the fuck

That I'm talkin' about when we riot

You dealin' with a few true villains

Who stand inside of a booth truthspillin'

And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings

Come flyin' up out of our mouths now rewind it

Payback motherfucker

For the way that you doubted me how's it taste

When I slap the taste outta your mouth

With the bass so loud that it shakes the place

I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face

You ain't gonna have no face to save

By the time I'm through with this place so Drake



It may not mean nothin' to y'all

But understand nothin' was done for me

So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I want this shit forever mane ever mane ever mane

I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall

And tellin' every girl she the one for me

And I ain't even plannin' to call

How I'm feeling it doesn't matter

Cause you know I'm okay

Instead I ask myself Why do you worry

When you know you know I'm the same

I know I know you don't love me baby

They're trying to take you away from me

Only over my dead body



I think I killed everybody in the game last year man

Fuck it I was on though

And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club mmmm

Fuck it I was wrong though

Shout out to all my niggas living tax free

Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me

Oh well I guess you lose some and win some

Long as the outcome is income

You know I want it all and then some

Shout out to Asian girls let the lights dim some

Shots came I don't know where they was sent from

Probably some bad hoes I'm about to take the hint from

Yeah you know me well nigga

I mean you ain't the only real nigga

They got me on these white women like Seal nigga

Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field nigga

Are these people really discussing my career again

Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again

Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again

Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in

Man all of your flows bore me paint drying

And I don't ever be tripping off of what ain't mine

And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine

But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time

YeahIt's been that way from the beginning

I just been playing I ain't even notice I was winning

And this is the only sound you should fear

Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright



Oh I know I know you don't love me baby

They're trying to take you away from me

Only over my dead body



You say I'm old news well who the new star

Cause if I'm going anywhere it's probably too far

Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States

Used half of the money to beat my brother's case

Red wine over Fed time

And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time

Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime

And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time

Yeah don't make me take your life apart boy

You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy

Oh you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy

Don't make me break your Kevin Hart boy

Yeah it's whatever

You know feeling good  living better

I think maybe I was numb to it last year

But you know I feel it now more than ever

My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay

Second album I'm back paving the way

The backpackers are back on the bandwagon

Like this was my comeback season back back in the day

And I met your baby moms last night

We took a picture together I hope she frames it

And I was drinking at the Palms last night

And ended up losing everything that I came with

Feel like I've been here before huh

I still got  years to go huh

And this is the only sound you should fear

Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right



Oh I know I know you don't love me baby

They're trying to take you away from me

Only over my dead body



Three in the morning still going down



I can see it in your eyes you're angry

Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now

Mad cause he ain't like me

Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me

All the care I would take

All the love that we made

Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you

It's a shame you didn't keep it

Alisha Catya I know that you gon' hear this

I'm the man yeah I said it

Bitch I'm the man don't you forget it

The way you walk that's me

The way you talk that's me

The way you've got your hair up did you forget that's me

And the voice in your speaker right now that's me

That's me and the voice in your ear

That's me can't you see

That I made it Yeah I made it

First I made you who you are and then I made it

And you're wasted with your latest

OK look I'm honest Girl I can't lie I miss you

You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to

I never cheated for the record back when I was with you

But you believed in everything but me girl I don't get you

She says I know you changed

I never see you cause you're always busy doing things

I really wish she had a different way of viewing things

I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things

It's such a small place not much to do but talk and listen

The men are jealous and the women all in competition

And all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret

And taint all the images of your Mr Perfect

I could tell that you been crying all night drinking all summer

Prayin' for your happiness hope that you recover uh

This is one I know you hated when you heard it

And it's worse because you know that I deserve it



Take a shot for me Ohohohoh ohohohoh

Take a shot for me Ohohohoh ohohohoh

Take a shot for me Uhhuh uhhuh ohwhoa oh whoa

A shot for me Uhhuh uhhuh ohwhoa oh whoa

A shot for me



Yeah

May your neighbors respect you

Trouble neglect you

Angels protect you

And heaven accept you



I might be too strung out on compliments

Overdosed on confidence

Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence

Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments

Faded way too long I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness

And they sayin' I'm back I'd agree with that

I just take my time with all this shit I still believe in that

I had someone tell me I fell off ooh I needed that

And they want to see me pick back up well where'd I leave it at

I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that

Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that

You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that

You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that

No don't do it Ayy please don't do it Ayy

'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it Ayy

And Drizzy got the money so Drizzy gonna pay it

Then she wanna ask when it got so empty

Tell her I apologize happened over time

She says They miss the old Drake girl don't tempt me

If they don't get it they'll be over you

That new shit that you got is overdue

You better do what you supposed to do

I'm like Why I gotta be all that

But still I can't deny the fact that it's true

Listening to you expressin' all them feelings

Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like All My Children

And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'

I guess it really is just me myself and all my millions

You know that they ain't even got it like that

You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that

'Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that

When they get my shit and play it

I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies

Rather hear what was or what will be than what is

Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you

Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you

Rather you make this an open letter

About family and struggle and it takin' forever

About hearts that you've broken and ties that you've severed

No doubt in my mind that'll make them feel better



Ooh ooh There's a there's a

Whoa yeah There's a

Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall

And really I think I like who I'm becoming

There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing

There's times when I might blow like k on a vacation

For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces

All it took was patience

I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me

The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me

The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me

I told my story and made history

Tell them I'ma need reservations for

You hate being alone well you ain't the only one

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures

And sitting talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had

I don't think I'm conscious

Of making monsters

Outta the women I sponsor

'Til it all goes bad

But shit it's all good

We threw a party yeah we threw a party

Bitches came over yeah we threw a party

I was just calling 'cause they were just leaving

Too many drinks have been given to me

Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed

Her white friend said You niggas crazy

'Cause if they did we gon' be in some trouble

If they did we gon' be in some trouble trouble



If you was in a pine box Box

I would surely break the lock

I'd jump right in anand fall asleep I fall asleep

'Cau'cau'cause you are the death of me 'Cause you are

If you was in a pine box Box

I would surely break the lock

I'd jump right in and fall asleep I fall asleep

'Cau'cau'cause you are the death of me

'Cause you are thethe death of me youyou the death of me



Lookin' in the mirror I'm embarrassed

I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist

React like an infant whenever you are mentioned

Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis

I'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt

When I said the music business was all I needed

When I got it I was greeted by an alien

That said last year that she slept with a Canadian

That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz

Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend

My vice is similar women love when you're my type

And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write

Put her in the Palms Hotel sin city

Devil in a dress Platinum Chanel live the ambiance all

'Cause the audience one day said I would do it

So instead of a verse bein' read

I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music

I tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat Capitalize That

And your weave look good with the Indian tracks

Trackin' device on your used  series

I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian

The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto

Hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me

A false word like the rappers I know

Sat down with a few drinks located where you can't see us

A white waitress on standby when we need her

A black Maybach  pulled up Jeep

No doors all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah

Felt like the initiation a reality livin' in the matrix

We talk casually about the industry

And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'

Then he said that he was the same age as myself

And it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient

So blame it on Mr OVOXO

The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know

The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life

But I live a double life and need to let her go

The reason why the highlight was when he said

You belong to the people when you're outside

So dig a shovel full of money full of power full of pussy

Full of fame and bury yourself alive then I died



Yeah



Bridge over troubled water ice in my muddy water

Rich off a mixtape got rich off a mixtape

Probably shouldn't be driving it just got so much harder

Can't even see it straight I can't even see it straight

Uh fuck with me I buy the shots

Live a little 'cause niggas die a lot

And lie a lot but I'm the truth  that's right I fucking said it

The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven

You girl you right there you look like you like this shit

How'd I know how'd I know That's me on some psychic shit

I can tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts

But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about

Rap and bitches rappin' bitches bitches

And rappin' rappin' and bitches until all of it switches I swear

It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was

I'm the greatest man I said that before I knew I was

That's what's important what really happened before this

When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans

Singing Walking like a man finger on the trigger

I got money in my pocket I'm a uptown nigga ah

With fame on my mind my girl on my nerves

I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve

That was back in the days Acura days

I was a cold dude I'm getting back to my ways



People always ask how I got my nice things

Take my crown to the grave I'm an underground king

I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told

'Cause I'm down to spend whatever lately I've been on a roll

And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga

Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga

Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga

Do it for the city UGK fuck these other niggas



Sometimes I need that romance

Sometimes I need that pole dance

Sometimes I need that stripper

That's gon' tell me that she don't dance

Tell me lies make it sound good make it sound good

Do me like the women from my town would

Leather with that woodgrain Persian rugs on wood floors

Talking all the good things that's all I'm really good for

Memphis Tennessee no see I start to go deep back

And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and EMack

And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth

And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south

And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like

So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like

So I drop out lessons I was taught are quick to fade

Soon as I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid

And if I don't do nothing I'ma ball

I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall yeah I need that

Making major changes to the life I'm living

I had no choice I had to prove I made the right decision

That was back in the days Acura days

I was a cold dude I'm getting back to my ways



People always ask how I got my nice things

Take my crown to the grave I'm an underground king

I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told

'Cause I'm down to spend whatever lately I've been on a roll

Maybe it's just right for the night

You said niggas coming on too strong girl

Why you want to fight for your right

Cause you don't love them boys

Pussy run everything fuck that noise

Just Blaze Lord knows



It's your worst nightmare it's my first night here

And this girl right here who knows what she knows

So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom

And her purse right there I don't trust these hoes at all

But that's just the result of me paying attention

To all these women that think like men with the same intentions

Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention

Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention

But Weezy and Stunna my only role models

Haffa and Jordan my only role models

That's why I walk around with all this gold on

And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems

Bottom sixes and chains and some bracelets and rings

All of the little accents that make me a king

I never hear the disses they try and point out to me

But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing

I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August

Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters

Get some shake a brick in the press

And chef it like Mrs Fields they're making the cookie stretch

I know it so well I know the hustle so well

Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel

Drug money outfit record clean

Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team

Matchin' Rollies for real matchin' Rovers for real Woo

Places they say they've been we actually going for real Woo

Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things Huh

With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs

Young ass nigga lifelong dreams

They take the greats from the past and compare us

I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era

In a time where it's recreation

To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations

I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at

Never the flow though they know I run that

Fuck you all I claim that whenever

I changed rap forever the game back together yeah

YM I remain that forever

In the same place my brother Wayne at forever

I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix

I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished

I'm hearing all of the jokes I know that they tryna push me

I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy

Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy

So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me

Lord knows Lord knows I'm heavy I got my weight up

Roberson boost your rate up it's time that somebody paid up

A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up

But if all I hear is me then who should I be afraid of

Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin' spooky

Very very scary like shit you see in the movies

In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy

That's why all the real soldiers salute me

Trill nigga for real



Huh You know I love this

YOLO You Only Live Once

I'm going so hard my nigga I swear homie

Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal

MMMaybach Music



I fell in love with the pen started fucking the ink Huh

The hustle's an art I painted what I would think

Still allergic to broke prescription straight to the paper

Destined for greatness but got a place in Jamaica Woo

Villa on the water with the wonderful views Views

Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews Jews

Went and got a yacht I'm talkin' Carnival cruise

And these niggas talking like hoes they mad they not in my shoes

It's the red bottom boss Huh came to buy the bar Huh

Every biweek shit I'm bound to buy a car Woo

Murdercedes Benz or that bubble double R Woo

Headlights flicking looking like a falling star

Every day them hammers bang whipping yay like Anna Mae Anna Mae

I run the gang but the ladies think I'm running game Running game

Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate Fornicate

Rozay and Drake I'm getting cake nothing short of great Huh

Just to tell me that I haven't changed girl I needed that from you

I'm gettin' money just taking care of me girl

I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now

I'm gettin' money just taking care of me girl

'Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now



Ooh oohoh ooh



But the good ones go

The good ones go if you wait too long

But the good ones go

The good ones go if you wait too long

So you should go

You should go before you stay too long



But don't you go getting married don't you go get engaged

I know you're getting older don't have no time to waste

I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait

Can't lose you can't help it I'm so sorry I'm so selfish

Uh uh I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down

In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so HTown

But when it's all done baby I'm yours if you're still around

She knows she knows she knows



Ooh oohoh ooh



But the good ones go

The good ones go if you wait too long

But the good ones go

The good ones go if you wait too long

So you should go

You should go before you stay too long



When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world

It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl

And she's the reason it happened but she's overreacting

And it's all because she don't want things to change



So cry if you need to but I can't stay to watch you

That's the wrong thing to do

Touch if you need to but I can't stay to hold you

That's the wrong thing to do

Talk if you need to but I can't stay to hear you

That's the wrong thing to do

Cause you'll say you love me and I'll end up lying

And say I love you too



But I need someone different

You know it oh ho you know it

Oh ho you know it we both know it

I need someone different

You know it oh ho you know it

Oh ho you know it we both know it

Something's been missing

You know it oh ho she knows it

Oh ho I know it we all know it

I need someone different

Oh ho oh ho



We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together

But we sure make it feel like we're together

Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else



So cry if you need to but I can't stay to watch you

That's the wrong thing to do

Touch if you need to but I can't stay to hold you

That's the wrong thing to do

Talk if you need to but I can't stay to hear you

That's the wrong thing to do

Cause you'll say you love me and I'll end up lying

And say I love you too



But I need someone different

You know it oh ho you know it

Oh ho you know it we both know it

I need someone different

You know it oh ho you know it

Oh ho you know it we both know it

Something's been missing

You know it oh ho she knows it

Oh ho I know it we all know it

I need someone different

Oh ho oh ho



People around you should really have nothing to say

Me I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way

And the weekend's here started it right

Even if you only get part of it right

Live for today plan for tomorrow

Party tonight party tonight

Dying to meet your girlfriends

That you said you might bring

If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing



Houston girls love the way it goes down

Atlanta girls love the way it goes down

Vegas girls love the way it goes down



But I gotta say oh babe oh babe why is this so familiar

Just met her already feel like I know the real her

You must've done this before this can't be your first time

We must've been here before it's still fresh on my mind

You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find

You must've done this before this can't be your first time



They keep telling me don't save you

If I ignore all that advice

Then something isn't right

Then who will I complain to

But the weekend's here started it right

Even if I only get part of it right

Live for today plan for tomorrow

Party tonight party tonight

You got your guards up I do too There's things we might discover

'Cause you got a past and I do too we're perfect for each other



Houston girls love the way it goes down

Atlanta girls love the way it goes down

Vegas girls love the way it goes down



But I gotta say oh babe oh babe why is this so familiar

Just met her already feel like I know the real her

You must've done this before this can't be your first time

We must've been here before it's still fresh on my mind

You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find

You must've done this before this can't be your first time



'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another

So if tonight's an accident tomorrow we'll recover

And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover

I don't wanna be in the blind but sometimes I Stevie Wonder

About her and she with it if I'm with it and I'm with it

I know what makes her smile but I wan' know what makes her different

Or should I just be realistic Lipstick on the glass

I know this ain't your first but it's better than your last

Tunechi



But I gotta say oh babe oh babe why is this so familiar

Just met her already feel like I know the real her

You must've done this before this can't be your first time

We must've been here before it's still fresh on my mind

You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find

You must've done this before this can't be your first time



Shower her with dollar tips

Shawty went and bought a whip

Guarantee the city remember your whole name

You throw that ho a scholarship

All of them ain't all equipped

And this saddens me I see the pecking order

Quoteunquote bad bitches work the whole floor

Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner

Like a lab rat nobody want her

Niggas that are married don't wanna go home

But we look up to them they wish they were us

They want some new trim

We lust for some trust

Now the both of us are colorblind

'Cause the other side looks greener

Which leaves your turf in the Boise state

Can't see her play or the team 'cause

Everybody has an addiction mine happens to be you

And those who say they don't

Souls will later on say to them that ain't true

All of them will have an opinion

But y'all know what you can do with them

But if you unsure I'll take you on tour

To a place you can stick that in

Well sitting here sad as hell

Listening to Adele I feel you baby

Someone like you more like someone unlike you

Or something that's familiar maybe

And I can tell that she wants a baby

And I can yell girl that you're crazy

Oh what the hell Nope can't be lazy

Please be careful bitches got the rabies



It's like ' in your basement

And I'm in love with Nebby

And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready

And your back hurt and your neck hurt

And you smoking heavy

And I sit next to you and I lecture you

Because those are deadly

And then you ash it and we argue

About spending money on bullshit

And you tell me I'm just like my father

My one button you push it

Now it's Fuck you I hate you I'll move out in a heartbeat

And I leave out and you call me you tell me that you sorry

You love me and I love you

And your heart hurts mine does too

And it's just words and they cut deep

But it's our world it's just us two

I see painkillers on the kitchen counter

I hate to see it all hurt so bad

But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard

If you were healthy and it weren't so bad

Uh maybe I should walk up the street

And try and get a job at the bank

Cause leave it up to me J and Neeks

We'll probably end up robbing the bank

Then Wayne calls up my phone

Conversation wasn't that long

Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning

Oh it's my time yeah it's on

He's thinking of signing me I come home

We make a mixtape with  songs

And almost get a Grammy off of that thing

They love your sonman that boy gone

You get the operation you dreamed of

And I finally send you to Rome

I get to make good on my promise

It all worked out girl we shoulda known

Cause you deserve it



Is this shit real Should I pinch you

After all the things that we been through I got you

Look what you've done look what you've done

Look what you've done for me now

You knew that I was gonna be something

When you're stressed out and you need something I got you

Look what you've done look what you've done



It's like ' in your backyard

I'm in love with Jade

And I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real

Is when it doesn't fade

And my father living in Memphis now he can't come this way

Over some minor charges and child support

That just wasn't paid damn

Boohoo sad storyblack American dad story

Know that I'm your sister's kid

But it still don't explain the love that you have for me

I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances

Damn your house felt like the Hamptons

For all of my summer romances

I never really had no one like you man this allnew shit

Made the world I know bigger

Changed the way that I viewed it

Had all this fighting going on at the crib

You would calm me down when I lose it

Told you I think I'm done acting

I'm more in touch with the music

You said either way I'll be a star I could go so far

Talked to me you got to me

Then you'd toss the keys and loan me your car

Yeah just a young kid in a drop top

Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested

Just another kid that's going through life

So worried that I won't be accepted

But I could do anything you said that and you meant that

You took me places you spent that

They said no we went back

Checks bounced but we bounced back

I put all the money in your accounts back

And I thank you I don't know where

I'd really be without that it worked out

Man you deserve it



Is this shit real Should I pinch you

After all the things that we been through I got you

It'll be a long time before y'all feel me if ever

For real



You won't feel me 'till everybody

Say they love you but it's not love

And your suit is oxblood

And the girl you fucking hates you

And your friends faded off shots of

What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of

Your famous girlfriend's ass keep getting thicker than a plot does

And when you forget it that's when she pop up

And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up

Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees

And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs

And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley

Scallops and glasses of Dolce that shit's right up your alley

You see a girl and you ask about her

Bitches smiling at you it must be happy hour

They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down

It's feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now

Walking through airport security with your hat down

Instead of getting a pat down they just keep on

Saying that they feel you nigga



I've been faded too long

I've been faded too long

I've been faded too long

Why won't it stop The ride

Why won't it stop The ride



You won't feel me 'til you want it so bad you tell yourself you're in it

And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished

And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image

And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted

You need a minute You got it

You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights

The sun is up when you get home that's just a way of life

Apartment  some couches and paintings

When you record with two others that want the same things

It start to feel better than home feels

And so you up there every night you swear you getting close

That champagne money was for gas and phone bills

But shit you bout to spend it on what matters most

You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga

And come out every night to let the city see they nigga

Telling stories that nobody relate to

And even though they hate you

They just keep on telling you they feel you nigga



I've been faded too long

I haven't been inside Terminal  and  in so long

Wassup



Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV

Young rebel Young Money nothin' you could tell me

Paperwork takin' too long maybe they don't understand me

I'll compromise if I have to I gotta stay with the family

Not even talkin' to Nicki communication is breakin'

I dropped the ball on some personal shit I need to embrace it

I'm honest I make mistakes I'd be the second to admit it

Think that's why I need her in my life to check me when I'm trippin'

On a mission tryna shift the culture

Tell me who dissin' I got some things that'll hit the culprit

Them strep throat flows them shits to stop all of the talkin'

All of the talkin' got one reply for all of your comments

Fuck what you think I'm too busy that's why you leave a message

Born a perfectionist guess that makes me a bit obsessive

That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure

Like ayy B I got your CD you get an E for effort

I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless

Owl chains like credentials you know you see the necklace

My life's a completed checklist

I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now

Just give it time we'll see who's still around a decade from now

That's real



How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro

Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento

I just set the bar niggas fall under it like a limbo

The family all that matters I'm just out here with my kinfolk

Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow

This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo

I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna Talk to 'em

The fresh prince just had dinner with Tatyana no lie

All these nineties fantasies on my mind

The difference is that with mine they all come true in due time

I might come through without security to check if you're fine

That's just me on my solo like Fuck it like YOLO

Wanted to tell you Accept yourself

You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself

And if you end up needin' some extra help then I could help

You know back on your feet and shit

Tryna get my karma up fuck the guilty and greedy shit

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro

How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though

Life is soundin' crazy  on Martin Scorsese

And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me

Now real nigga wassup

Ayy yeah ayy

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro



If there's hell below I'll see you when you get there

Are you enjoyin' yourselves

If we may we would just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational

Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears shedding similar tears and of course dying in so many years

It don't mean that we can't have a good life

So we'd like to just maybe close out with something some food for thought for all of us



Somewhere between psychotic and iconic

Somewhere between I want it and I got it

Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted

Somewhere between a mistress and commitment

But I stay down girl I always stay down

Get down never lay down

Promise to break everybody off before I break down

Everyone just wait now so much on my plate now

People I believed in they don't even show they face now

What they got to say now Nothin' they can say now

Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now

What more can I say now What more can I say now

You might feel like nothin' was the same



I still been drinkin' on the low mobbin' on the low

Fuckin' on the low smokin' on the low

I still been plottin' on the low schemin' on the low

The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

I just been drinkin' on the low mobbin' on the low

Fuckin' on the low smokin' on the low

I just been plottin' on the low schemin' on the low

The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know



And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya

Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya

You know that paper my passion

Bittersweet celebrations I know I can't change what happened

I can't help it I can't help it I was young and I was selfish

I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's

And now you hate me stop pretendin' stop that frontin' I can't take it

Girl don't treat me like a stranger girl you know I seen you naked

Girl you know that I remember don't be a pretender

Gettin' high at the condo that's when it all comes together

You know I stay reminiscing and makeup sex is tradition

But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same



I still been drinkin' on the low mobbin' on the low

Fuckin' on the low smokin' on the low

I still been plottin' on the low schemin' on the low

The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

I just been drinkin' on the low mobbin' on the low

Fuckin' on the low smokin' on the low

I just been plottin' on the low schemin' on the low

The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know



Drinkin' smokin' fuckin' plottin'

Schemin' plottin' schemin' gettin' money

Drinkin' fuckin' smokin' plottin'

Schemin' plottin' schemin' gettin' money



Uh this the life for me

My momma told me this was right for me

I got 'em worried like make sure you save a slice for me

I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me

Your actions make us doubt you

Your lack of effort got me rappin' different

This the shit I wanna go out to

Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'

Naked women swimmin' that's just how I'm livin'

Donate a million to some children that's just how I'm feelin'

A nigga fillin' up arenas who the fuck could see us

I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the reup

Yours truly the boy

I just build and build more y'all niggas build to destroy

Y'all niggas party too much man I just chill and record

I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets I know

Luckily I didn't have to grow there

I would only go there 'cause niggas that I know there

I don't know what's getting into me I just like the rush

When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize

He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy

You ain't ever worried 'cause he's not who he pretends to be

People like Mazin who was a best friend to me

Start to become a distant memory

Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy

And fuckin' with me mentally I think it's meant to be

Yeah paranoid always rolling with my motherfuckin' boys

But you gotta understand when it's yours

You tell me who flop who copped the new drop

Whose jewels got rocks

Who else making rap albums doing numbers like it's pop

Same old pimp Drake you know ain't nothin' changed

With these funny style niggas we done put on in the game

I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave

Then it's back to LA open the mail starin' at the check

Enough to make you throw up man it's gross what I net

I'm with my whole set tennis matches at the crib

I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left

Oh where I reside it look like a resort inside

Nigga where your shit from I imported mine

Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai

Fuck you bitch I'm more than high

My momma probably hear that and be mortified

This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura

 AM then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside

For all the stuntin' I'll forever be immortalized

Yeah back and forth across the borderline

Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime

What's up

Been a minute since we kicked it you've been caught up

With them bitches I don't get it you're a star love

You shouldn't have to deal with that

I'd never make you feel like that

'Cause



I love me

I love me enough for the both of us

That's why you trust me

I know you been through more than most of us

So what are you

What are you what are you so afraid of

Darling you

You give but you cannot take love



Yeah I needed to hear that shit I hate when you're submissive

Passive aggressive when we're texting I feel the distance

I look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping

I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different

Started realizing a couple places I could take it

I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement

I want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation

And influence a generation that's lacking in patience

I've been dealing with my dad speaking of lack of patience

Just me and my old man getting back to basics

We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted

When he put that bottle down girl that nigga's amazing

Well fuck it we had a couple Coronas

We might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us

We even talked about you and our couple of moments

He said we should hash it out like a couple of grownups

You a flower child beautiful child I'm in your zone

Looking like you came from the seventies on your own

My mother is sixtysix and her favorite line to hit me with is

Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone

You don't even know what you want from love anymore

I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored

But girl what qualities was I looking for before

Who you settling for Who better for you than the boy huh



I love me

I love me enough for the both of us

That's why you trust me

I know you been through more than most of us

So what are you

What are you what are you so afraid of

Darling you

You give but you cannot take love



Uh thinking 'bout Texas back when Porscha used to work at Treasures

Or further back than that before I had the Houston leverage

When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit

A weak attempt at flexing I'll never forget it

'Cause that night I played her three songs

Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on

Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz

Boy was she wrong

That was just negative energy for me to feed off

Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria

Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria

Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music

When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it

The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree

I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me

Now she engaged to be married what's the rush on commitment

Know we were going through some shit name a couple that isn't

Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz

Girl I felt like we had it all planned out

I guess I fucked up the vision

Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions

When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven

It seem like you don't want this love anymore

I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore

But girl what qualities was I looking for before

Who you settling for Who better for you than the boy huh



I love me

I love me enough for the both of us

That's why you trust me

I know you been through more than most of us

So what are you

What are you what are you so afraid of

Darling you

You give but you cannot take love

How every conversation starts with This time will be different

Oh oh the idea is fun

She used to say You can be whoever you want even yourself

Yeah I show up knowin' exactly who I was

Ah Don't think about



Done sayin' I'm done playin'

Last time was on the outro

Stuck in the house need to get out more

I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraisin'



Most people in my position get complacent

Wanna come places with star girls

And then end up on them front pages

I'm quiet with it I just ride with it

Moment I stop havin' fun with it I'll be done with it

I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up

And like a potluck you need to come with it



Don't run from it like HTown in the summer time I keep it 

Met a lot of girls in my times there word to Paul Wall not one fronted



I was birthed there in my first year

Man I know that place like I come from it

Backstage at Warehouse in ' like Is Bun comin'

Fuck that is anyone comin' before I show up there and there's no one there

These days I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there

And now he's actin' like Oh well this is life I guess

Nah fuck that shit

Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign that's when they appear

Guess since my text message didn't resonate I'll just say it here

Tellin' herself that she's too sick

To get dressed up and go do shit like that's true shit

Don't do that



Don't give up on your hopes

And you tell me something's gone wrong

Wholehearted wholehearted you care you care

Good God Almightylike back in the old days

You know years ago they had the AR men to tell you what to play how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock

But uh we just went in the studio and we did it

We had the champagne in the studio of course

You know compliments of the company

And we just laid back and did it

So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you

Because we had a ball

Only real music is gonna last

All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

I'm fresh out of AdvilJesus grab the wheel







Yeah uh

Look fuck all that Happy to be here shit that y'all want me on

I'm the big homie they still be tryna lil bro me dog

Like I should fall in line

Like I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy

And not say I'm the greatest of my generation

Like I should be dressing different

Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic

Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive

Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit

And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us

Like I didn't study the game to the letter

And understand that I'm not doin' it the same

Man I'm doing it better

Like I didn't make that clearer this year

Like I should feel I don't know guilty for saying that

They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself

These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself

But I thought Fuck it it's worth it to share 'em

With someone else other than Paris for once

I text her from time to time she a mom now

I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down

I told her she could live with me if she need to I got a compound

But I think she's straight

'Cause she supported since Hot Beats

Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room

Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have

In the hopes for the glory

He walked right past in the hallway

Three months later I'm his artist

He probably wouldn't remember that story

But that shit stick with me always

Couldn't believe when he called me

You never know what could happen to you

And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti

And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do

Yeah I guess that's just who I became dawg

Nothing was the same dawg





Gotta do what I gotta do yeah



All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait

Or they go to Georgia State where tuition is handled

By some random nigga that live in Atlanta

That she only see when she feels obligated

Admitted it to me the first time we dated

But she was no angel and we never waited

I took her for sushi she wanted to fuck

So we took it to go told 'em don't even plate it

And we never talk too much after I blew up

Just only hello or a happy belated

And I think I text her and told her I made it

And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it

And that's when I text her and told her I love her

Then right after texted and told her I'm faded

She asked what have I learned since getting richer

I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures

I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture

Even though it's fucked up girl I'm still fucking with ya

Damn is it the fall time for me to revisit the past

There's women to call there's albums to drop there's liquor involved

There's stories to tell we been through it all Damn

Interviews are like confessions

Get the fuck up out my dressing room confusing me with questions like



Do you love this shit Are you high right now

Do you ever get nervous

Are you single I heard you fucked your girl is it true

You getting money

You think them niggas you with is with you



And I say hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah

Fuckin' right fuckin' right alright

And we say hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah

Fuckin' right fuckin' right alright



Uh so much for being optimistic

They say love is in the air so I

Hold my breath until my face turn purple

Keep a few bad bitches in my circle

My nuts hang like ain't no curfew

Bitch if you wave then I will surf you

I flew jet she flew commercial

But we still met later that night

After my session she came over

I was aggressive and she was sober

I gave her a pill she started confessing

And started undressing and ask me to hold her

And so I did but that was last month

And now she's texting me asking for closure

Damn she say this shit gon' catch up to me I keep tissue paper

We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table

She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average

Shit sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married

Promises I hope I never break 'em

Met a female dragon had a fire conversation

But interviews are like confessions

Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

The timing ain't right

Maybe one day but even one day with us is the time of her life

We do things that people pay to document

You got the sweetest heart

But I'm not here to give out compliments

Or boost nobody's confidence momma

I got no friends in this momma

I don't pretend with this momma

I'on joke with this momma

I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it momma

I'm Game of Thrones with it momma

I'm Home Alone with it momma

I'm t

I really hate using this tone with you momma

I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you momma

I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma

It's just they cloning me momma

Them niggas wannabes momma

Its like  I'm the one they wanna be momma

I just I I can't be out here being vulnerable momma

I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me momma

I sing a hook they sing along with me momma

What more they want from me momma

Yeah this is a crazy life

But you and the six raised me right

Don't ever take advice that was great advice



You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life



Yeah

Having conversations with momma we start talkin' 'bout dad

You know he dropping a single he saying this is his window

That nigga still wearing linen that nigga still in the club

Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love

That nigga Memphis for real girl he love you to death

He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept

But he just want our forgiveness and fuck it look how we're living

I'm content with this story who are we not to forgive him

At least I been to a prison at least I know what it's like

I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life

And now I got me a Grammy that could be part of the reason

Let's just call this shit even we got some things to believe in

Do you remember back to Weston Road Scarlett Road

Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny

Shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma

He never let me do drugs

He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does

He made me listen to his music old music soul music

Shit that can only be created if you go through it

I used to get teased for being black

And now I'm here and I'm not black enough

'Cause I'm not acting tough

Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from yeah

But I just roll with it momma rolling stone with it momma

Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone

Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma

I'm not condoning it momma

They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma

Know I don't call enough momma

I just been working with so little time for personal momma yeah

Hard labor let me pay the price



You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life





Rock me real slowly

Put a bib on me

I'm just like a baby droolin' over you

The things you do



These days I'm lettin' God handle all things above me

The things I can't change are the reason you love me

Listen you can hear them callin' my name

I'm all over the place I can't sit in one place

I'm not ashamed at all

Still findin' myself let alone a soulmate I'm just sayin'

Feel like we one and the same our relationship changed

That or it never existed

Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us you listen

But fuck what they talkin' about on your time line

That's cuttin' all into my time with you

Fuck what they talkin' about on your time line

That's cuttin' all into my time with you

My time with you my



Rock me real slowly

Put a bib on me

I'm just like a baby droolin' over you

The things you do



She said you're my everything

I love you through everything I done did everything to her

She forgave me for everything this a forever thing

Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing

Trust me girl this shit is everything to me

She from the jungle she from the jungle

I take somebody else's car drive there undercover

This shit is everything to me this shit is everything

Don't know where we stand I used to hit you 'bout everything



Are we still good Are we still good

Are we still good Are we still good

If I need to talk are you around

Are you down for the cause

Are you down Are you down Are you down

Are you down for the cause



Are you down Are you down Are you down

Are you down for the cause

You still down You still down You still down



Rock me real slowly

Put a bib on me

I'm just like a baby droolin' over you

The things you do



Yeah these days these new girls they got me nervous

They go to school and do bottle service

They can't decide they keep switchin' majors

Being indecisive makes me anxious

Call your number and it's out of service



Who can I call for your information

What am I supposed to do

After we done everything that we've done

Who is your replacement

Are we still good Are we still good

Are we still good Are we still good



Rock me real slowly

Put a bib on me

I'm just like a baby droolin' over you

The things you do





Oh you gotta love it oh you gotoh you gotta love it

I heard what circulated let's get to the bottom of it

I told da send me something and I got it covered

Somehow I always rise above it

Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover

The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive

Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor

Every shot you see 'em take at me they all contested

Allen Iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question

Last night I went to sleep wanting more

Tryna decide what direction I should go towards

Some nights I wish I could go back in life

Not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice

 at midnight wonder what's next for me

Longevity wonder how long they'll check for me

Prolly forever if I stay in my zone

I speak on this generation but can't change it alone

I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe

That's quite a platform you chose you should've kept it inside

Oh you tried It's so childish calling my name on the world stage

You need to act your age and not your girl's age

It gets worse by the annual

My career's like a howto manual so I guess it's understandable man

Oh you gotta love it you gotta love it yeah

I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em

To show they outfits off guess they need the attention

I remember when it used to be music that did it

But then again times have changed man who are we kiddin'

I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with

I'd rather give that  to people I fuck with

If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'

We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on

But here we are yeah

Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence

They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments

Bitches alter my messages like we had words

And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve

Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing

Crazy this yearfuckin' with my image

I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year

Fuck it I guess I gotta wait 'til next year

And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot

'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block

Nobody lookin' out for nobody

Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody

Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news so everybody can tweet about it

And then they start to RIP about it

And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it

Damn I just had to say my piece about it

Oh you gotta love it

But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public that's a hotter subject

I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget

I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins

Shout out to Ashley Tasha Bianca

Julia Ericka Southern America

Part of my heritage pardon my arrogance

Part in my hair again that's that comeback flow

Comeback flow once I start it's apparent

I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'

But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement

Your content so aggressive lately what's irkin' you

Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too

I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas

Bein' number two is just being the first to lose

My city dictated music nobody seein' us

Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up

Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough

Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up

Yeah boy you rappin' like you seen it all

You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all

Best I Ever Had seems like a decade ago

Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go

Oh please take it ease where's the love and the peace

Why you rappin' like you come from the streets

I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees

And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves

Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease

I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese

Special order for anybody that's comin' for me

Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze

You see they got me back talkin' like it's just  Oli and me

Cuttin' all loose ends I be the barber for free

I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat

Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats

Man oh you gotta love it yeah

And on top of that it's getting harder to eat

Rappers downgrading houses putting cars on the lease

To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me

And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe

But man oh you gotta love it Oh

Yeah

And head to toe I'm Prada covered Whoop

I know your girl well just not in public

Blame the city I'm a product of it

Young nigga from the city

You gotta love it



Yeah gotta love it

Yeah





Yeah that's about it

This shit sound like what being rich feel like for real

This life shit is everywhere you can't control it

Too much going on

Too much too much too much

Too much too much too much

You you you

Make me wanna take you down through there

Make me wanna take you down through there

I'll take it there



Why you never come to where I stay

Always hiding out in your New York condo

Why you never come to where I stay

If anybody knows girl you know I know

Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship

Why are we rushing and forcing it

This isn't making sense

Why are we focused on things

That don't even mean nothing girl

Why can we not find the time

And sit down and discuss it girl

Let me at least tell you my side of things man

Aw man aw man aw man



Me and you are playing house

Start thinking that I'm losing touch

Got a tight grip on you now

Maybe I should loosen up

When I leave you and I go home

I start forgetting what it is

Start to think I got to get it how I live

We too busy for a wedding or a kid

If I'm working then I know you working

Keep in touch with other women

'Cause you make me nervous

I empower girls that don't deserve it

I don't mean to do that shit on purpose

It's just that when I go home

I start forgetting what it is

The dream is over I get lost up in the 



And you don't ever come to where I stay at

You just rather stay up in your New York condo

You don't ever come to where I stay at

If anybody knows girl you know I know

Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship

You know how sticky these situations get

You go up higher than me some days

You know what I think we could be some day

Let me at least show you my side of things man

Aw man aw man aw man





It's a little chilly out there

How you can stand there is beyond me



All of my let's just be friends are friends I don't have anymore

How do you not check on me when things go wrong

Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer

Much closer

All of my let's just be friends are friends I don't have anymore

Guess that's what they say you need family for

Cause I can't depend on you anymore



Always saw you for what you could've been

Ever since you met me

Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley

I always saw you for what you could've been

And even when it's business with you it's personal again

I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end



And it's all because you chose a side

You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me

Guess it wasn't time yeah

And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine



You're so predictable I hate people like you

Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you

How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through

You can't even figure out what's going on with you

You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures

I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas

With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong

Out here in LA I don't know what's going on

I don't know what's going on



And it's all because you chose a side

You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me

Guess it wasn't time yeah

And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine



You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align

My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right

When I needed you you couldn't give me any advice

But you always had something to say every other time

Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way

I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage

Someone up there must just love testing my patience

Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment

Forgiveness for your ways

If I ever loved ya I'll always love ya that's how I was raised

Same way I'm right here still feeling the way

Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that



All of my let's just be friends are friends I don't have anymore

How do you not check on me when things go wrong

Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer

Much closer

All of my let's just be friends are friends I don't have anymore

Guess that's what they say you need your family for

Cause I can't depend on you anymore

Much closer



Any time people want to start problems

It's like for real are you dumb

You know who mans are

I'm not afraid no gyal heart man

And I'm not afraid of no cyattie

And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither

So anybody who want it can get it

Seh feh





Yeah for the dogs dem you know

Man when shit gets like this man the whole city

Shit's crazy right now and shit ain't gonna stop

Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better



Look momma hit my phone and said rap's no good

Better than her telling me the check's no good

Now they wanna act like I do no good

Funny 'cause I really did more than I should

I made a decision last night that I would die for it

Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it

Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it

You know  wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it

And I can't sleep these days unless I take one

If they don't have a story these days they'll make one

Life is always on man I never get a break from it

Doesn't matter where I go I can never get away from it

They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it

Same way breads gotta break for it

Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now

And I turn the six upside down it's a nine now

I made a decision last night that I would die for it



Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas

Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas

Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas

Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas



All these hand outs man it's getting outta hand

I'ma start telling niggas Get it how you can

I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend

If I ever lose I bet we never speak again

I made a decision last night I'd die for it

Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it

First place first place man we can't be tied for it

I only drove it five times paid  for it

Keychain go jangalang I wanna do major things

MJ in every way I just don't fade away

Six upside down it's a nine now

Like Mannie like Stunna man shit is big time now

And I made a decision last night that I would die for it



Dying yeah yeah gangstas gangstas gangstas

Trust me when I say that shit is old moves

God made himself a way from me to you

Tried to kill me but they still want the Views

Tried to kill me but they still want the Views

Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side

Yeah I said I am very much alive on the six side

I said I am





What these bitches want from a nigga



On some DMX shit

I group DM my exes

I tell 'em they belong to me that goes on for forever

And I think we just get closer when we're not together

You tell me that I'm confusin'

More immature than Marques Houston

Cuts too deep for a bandaid solution

We too deep in this thing you'll never lose me

LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'

Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off

I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras

I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars

That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off

And my house is the definition

Of alcohol and weed addiction

You got a different vision

You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen

Without runnin' into one of my niggas

That's not the way we livin'

Too much goin' on it's just not realistic

These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em

And you shouldn't miss 'em either we different people

But every time we speakin'



It's like a lot of games bein' played

How's it goin' down

If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now

Playin' mime games we both doin' the same thing

Slide on a late night

You like to slide on a late night

And on my way to make this dough

You cannot be here right next to me

Don't you see Riri right next to me

I hate a rapper especially

They feel the same but they hide it

They just discuss it in private

Don't get along man we tried it

What's the point in even tryin'

I hate a goofy especially

They always dyin' to mention me

They gotta die out eventually

I cannot give you the recipe

You know the game is sold separately

Swear I just had an epiphany

It cost me  at Tiffany's

Shout out to Tiffany Stephanie

They used to always come check for me

My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies

I don't let it get to me

I had to count it and count it again

To make sure the money was right

They love to talk

Views already a classic

Bustin' ones out the plastic

Her gram too poppin' to fuck her

The chain too heavy to tuck it I'm serious

I feed my family with this

So don't play with my money this summer I'm serious

I don't run out of material

You shouldn't speak on me period

You try to give 'em your side of the story

One of dem onesright



Weston Road Flows I did this shit for my nigga Renny

Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies

Feel like we go back a century run in the store for Centuries

Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it

He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement

He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment

Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission

We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him

Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know

Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show

I'm looking at they first week numbers like What are those

I mean you boys not even coming close

I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration

You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places

Look in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear

Creepin' like Chilli without the tender love and care

No tender love and care no love and affection

I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting

I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson

Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together

Yeah but here we are and it's a new semester

 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure

A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'

A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation

Your best day is my worst day I get green like Earth Day

You treat me like I'm born yesterday you forgot my birthday

You don't be scorin' perfect

You don't be workin' like how we be workin'

You platinum like wrappers

On Hershey's boy that shit is worthless

You get the message over and over like it was urgent

And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person

The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in

And did it with a purpose

Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships

Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension

A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned

Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention

It's rainin' money Oklahoma City Thunder

The most successful rapper  and under

I'm assumin' everybody's  and under

That's when I plan to retire man it's already funded

Yeah I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin

She violated I sent her back where it all started

How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment

Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness

Told my momma that I found a lady in the east

Cancun when I got signed they upgraded the suite

Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free

I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me

You wouldn't tell me you loved me started seein' Monique

Last time I heard from Monique TMinus was makin' beats

I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat

Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE

The best ever don't ever question you know better

But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewn together

Yeah I let that last line breathe it take a second to get it

Weston Road flows my confidence level gettin' settled

Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal

Don't let your newfound fame fool you

Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely I really do this

Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter

Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit

Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis I been through it

Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it

Too busy face screwin' on waste movements

You was ridin' TTC metro I had the place boomin'

First take Drake you know I rarely have to take two it

And they still take to it

Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid

And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it

But money can't buy happiness Jellee talkin' truthful

But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want

Get high when I want



Yeah that's right yeah





Yeah I get it

I get it yeah



Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way

Why would I tell you I'm  away if I'm not on the way

Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces

Why do I want an independent woman

To feel like she needs meI lost my way



I'm searchin' for these words to say to you

Please give me time

'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you

Oh please give me time

'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

Redemption's on your mind when you think about me yeah

Redemption's on your mind when you think about me yeah



Run your mouth I'd rather listen to someone else

I gave your nickname to someone else

I know you're seein' someone that loves you

And I don't want you to see no one else

I don't want you here with no one else

I don't wanna do this with no one else

I used to know you back when you was young

Your brother brought me through you saw me

That made me think of you so differently

I miss the feeling of you missing me

But you say you're over and done with me

Aw yeah yeah yeah

'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now



Damn I'm not unrealistic with none of my women

I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it

Relationships slowin' me down they slow down the vision

Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment

Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me

That mean a lot to me

Not havin' closure it take a lot out of me

This year for Christmas I just want apologies

Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'

Syn had a baby and treated me different

Erika sued me and opened a business

Wonder if they wish it could've been different

Wonder what they'd do put in my position

I wonder when my shit drop do they listen

Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions

I hate the number  that shit is unforgiving

Tryna satisfy everybody it's like they can't get enough

Until enough is enough and then it's too much

You tip the scale when I weigh my options

West Palm girls are spoiled rotten

Tiffany on you you know you poppin'

I'll kill somebody if they give you problems

Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'

Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet

I'm a walkin' comeup I'm a bank deposit

Sell my secrets and get top dollar

Sell my secrets for a Range Rover

Opportunity and temptation

They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation

Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'

Who's gonna save me when I need savin'

Since Take Care I've been caretakin'

But second chances that ain't how you livin'

Redemption on your mind I'll never be forgiven

You saw it in me at  years old

The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code

I got a pure soul I don't do the hate

You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made

Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change

Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game

Still drop  with liquor in my system

Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance

I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya

Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian

Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale

And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales

Tippin' scales bars heavy like triple XL

I never tag no one in I'd rather get you myself

Runnin' through the  thumbin' through the contracts

I'm possessed you can see it under the contacts

They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon

I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room

Payment plan for the family debt we in the minus

And like it's goin' in a trunk I put it all behind us

Where you tryna go I got it I'll take us wherever

I'm a staple in the game all my papers together

And my life is on display like Truman

They wanna pree the movements gotta start to make 'em sooner

My exes made some of my favorite music

I dated women from my favorite movies

Karma's such a thing of beauty

I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it

It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters

I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever

I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you

If I was you I wouldn't like me either

Yeah

Got a reputation for yourself now

Everybody knows and I feel left out

Running out of pages in your passport

Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before



You used to call me on my cell phone

Latenight when you need my love

Call me on my cell phone

Latenight when you need my love

And I know when that hotline bling

That can only mean one thing

I know when that hotline bling

That can only mean one thing



These days all I do is

Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else

Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else

Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else

You don't need no one else

You don't need nobody else no

Why you never alone

Why you always touching road

Used to always stay at home

Be a good girl you was in the zone

Yeah you should just be yourself

Right now you're someone else



You used to call me on my cell phone

Latenight when you need my love

Call me on my cell phone

Latenight when you need my love

And I know when that hotline bling

That can only mean one thing

I know when that hotline bling

That can only mean one thing



Ever since I left the city





Is it the strength of your feelings

Overthrowing your pain

You'll see new heights you'll be reaching

And is it today that you will find your new release

And in your wake ripple your sweet fate

And more chune for your headtop

So watch how you speak on my name you know



Yeah I couldn't get a bill paid

You couldn't buy the real thing

I was stayin' up at yo' place

Tryin' to figure out the whole thing

I saw people doin' things

Almost gave up on the music thing

But we all so spoiled now

More life more everything

Must have never had your phone tapped

All that yappin' on the phone shit

You must really love the road life

All that never comin' home shit

Your heart is hard to carry after dark

You're to blame for what we could have been

'Cause look at what we are

Your friends are scared to tell you you went too far

Funny that it's always been all about you from the start

No snow tires the Range slipslide like Trick Daddy and Trina

Oli North pull in like  million a season

Queen Street visions that nobody believed in

If we not on the charts my XO niggas eatin'

Fiftytwo consecutive weekends shout out to Weeknd

The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'

Not when everybody out here beefin'

We got it now we just gotta keep it

America's most wanted man I'm still on the run

All these number ones and we still not the ones

No hard feelings but I'll still get you spun

Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb

Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'

My competition it's beyond offensive

I'm in it for the glory not the honor mention

Not tryna be fourth and inches I'm tryna go the distance

Yeah distance I'm on a different mission

This the remix to Ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen

How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches

Too overly ambitious too late to fix it

Too late for condolences when it's over with

I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it

Be open with people I need some closure with

Be honest with myself and take ownership

Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn

I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first

Excitin' times revitalized

Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively

I'm just takin' what God will give me

Grateful like Jerry Bob and Mickey

Better attitude we'll see where it gets me

I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky

I wrote the book on worldclass finesses

And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts

And never placin' second

And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second

Inspirin' and never takin' credit

I know I deserve more I just never said it

Two middle fingers as I make a exit yeah



Did I lose you

Did I Did I

Did I lose you

Did I Did I

Did I lose you



Winnin' is problematic

People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'

Not when you have it

Way less support from my peers

In recent years as I get established

Unforgivin' times but fuck it I manage

Why is my struggle different than others'

Only child that's takin' care of his mother

As health worsens and bills double

That's not respectable all of a sudden

I don't get a pat on the back for the come up

What do you see when you see me

When did all the things I mean

From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning

Maybe I share it with too many people

Back then it used to just feel like our secret

Back when I would write

And not think about how they receive it

I be tryna manifest the things I needed

And look now I mean it's hard to believe it even for me

But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all

How they go from not wantin' me at all

To wantin' to see me lose it all

Things get dark but my aura just starts glowin'

I'm overcome with emotions

Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober

Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra

I could only speak what I know of

Man we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'

And icy Heineken drinkin' and rival neighborhoods linkin'

And puttin' your trust in someone

With the risk of financially sinkin'

All you did was write the book on garbageass Rollies

Ego strokin' picture postin'

Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only

But you just had to show me

See I know 'cause I study you closely

I know when someone lyin'

I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired

I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet

Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you



Did I Did I

Did I lose you

Did I Did I

Did I lose you



This is the 's year

Six hundreds instead of six OVO

You know we'll be rockin' our asses out

To my big brother Drizzy

You know what I'm sayin'

More Life  to the world gang shit





Uh man fresh up out the sand February tan

It's The Boy but I'm still the man come and get your mans

I don't know first you caught the hands then you took the stand

It's a joke but you say you realI don't understand

On a yacht me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs

We evolved used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls

Swear to God shout to Buffalo never duckin' low

I don't stop man I'm stuck on go always hug the road

Fuck a opp make his body roll yeah a lot of those

Started out doin' college shows Calipari flow

Then I popped like you never seen

We with everything I went off in the ' give me '



Want a lot can't have everything can't have everything

Want a lot can't have everything but I want everything



Bad attitude tellin' who to calm down

Tryna cool it all down who's callin' my name

Who's involved now Tell me who I gotta down

I'll do a song now man

Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now man

Everything that went around is comin' back around

Man my record deal should be  million goddamn



Can't have everything can't have everything

Want a lot can't have everything but I want everything



Finally got my mind in a free state

Niggas tried to serve me up a cheese steak

I gave them back a clean plate

Same niggas preein' 'cause they hate to see the team straight

Same niggas beakin' always duckin' my release dates

That's when the phone starts ringin' like Are we straight

Twofaced niggas back around with the three face

Damn ol' triple double Russ face watch with the bust face

NevermettheplugbutIrapabouttheplug face

Nevermetmyself Idon'trememberwhoIwas face

All that shit embarrassin'

Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again

He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance

All that's in my account at the Bank of America

All that Drake hysteria

 side East side all that for my area



You know hun I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust But that attitude will just hold you back in this life and you're going to continue to feel alienated Give some thought to this because I'm confident in you and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days When others go low we go high





Watch out for me I'm bound to glow

You better watch out for me I'm bound to glow



Your boy all glowed up

Every time we touch down bet it go up

'Member doin' shows ain't nobody show up

Pour your heart out ain't nobody show love

They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck

'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up



Watch out for me I'm about to glow



Time to shake the dice time to change the light

No more  to  autopilot drive

Used to work the fries now we supersize

'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof

Man the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof



Watch out for me I'm about to glow

Jeffery Mario

Jeffery ayy

Whoa whoa whoa whoa

Whoa whoa whoa whoa Jeffery Jeffery

Whoa whoa whoa whoa





Silence keeps cloudin' me

Hand on my heart

And I I wish time never mattered



Yeah stylin' though

Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though

All the things you need you still want problems though

All the things I know I still been silent though

Yeah used to be at SilverCity Indigo

Used to be in lunchroom playin' dominoes

I don't want to have to go to funerals

I gotta start sleepin' at the studio

I don't have no time to be no Romeo

All the love I need is at the rodeo

All the love I need is here at OVO yeah

All the girls I know are there with E and Tho

Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old

Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes

Last table left in Carbone callin' plays on the rotary phone

I take a glass of Domina to go with me home

Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome

I need  people to see what I'm on

Yeah ducked a lot of spiteful moves

I was an angry youth when I was writin' Views

Saw a side of myself that I just never knew

I'll probably selfdestruct if I ever lose but I never do

Steady doin' double shifts

da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click

More blessings because I'm generous

Thirtyseater plane for like ten of us

Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet

She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it

Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it

Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it

Scary whenever I close my eyes at night

Wakin' up to public statements about my private life

I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights

But you can rest assured that my mind is right

Get no sick days I leave for like three months in six days

Never stick around to see shit change

Get lil' updates texts in my inboxes have been poppin'

Seasons go by like I'm bingewatchin'

Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV

To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'

I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this

Distractions will do you in in the truest sense

Especially people that want to lecture me

And frame it like they just want the best for me

Or they check for me whatever splits it up

So there's more for them and there's less for me

They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me

No one's done it successfully

 AM in Germany can't believe that they heard of me

Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery

Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me

That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency

Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally

Take this shit to heart it's always executed perfectly

If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me

You overnight celebrity you one day star

Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity

I am a reflection of all of your insecurities

Behind closed doors a lot of  god worshipping

Done talk now 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me

There's real ones around me

I want to make sure they learn from me

I want to see my dog but his grandmother's his surety

He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency

My life is centered 'round competition and currency

Takin' summer off 'cause they tell me I need recovery

Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me

I'll be back  to give you the summary

More Life





I been waitin' on this

Yeah



All of this disorder no addressin'

The crown is broken in pieces but there's more in my possession

There's a whole lot in my possession

Who do you really love Well that's sure to be in question

My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions

Who's givin' out this much return on investment

After my run man how is that even a question

After this summer man how is that even a

I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'

Takin' shots with the GOAT and talked about shots that we sendin'

I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'

I've had too many nights to mention that's just the beginnin'

I'm pretty sure we got a label I'm still independent

I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit

Seen this movie a hundred times I know where it's headed

Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it

Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content

That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked

I am a creamofthecrop nigga

You niggas pop mollies my 'Malis pop niggas

House on both coasts but I live on the charts

I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks

And I see in the dark wasn't this cold at the start

Think my soul has been marked there's a hole in my heart

Yeah I was about toman I thought about it

It's unsettlin' to talk about it

Free all of my niggas that they caught with it

RIP my niggas that they caught without it

This just the intro let me not get ahead of myself

This is God's plan young man you said it yourself

Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt

Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac he dresses himself

I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself

Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself

I ain't even have to cut the tie it severed itself

This just the intro let me not get ahead of myself





Tay Keith fuck these niggas up



Look I just flipped a switch Flipped flipped

I don't know nobody else that's doin' this

Bodies start to drop ayy Hit the floor

Now they wanna know me since I hit the top ayy

This a Rollie not a stopwatch shit don't ever stop

This the flow that got the block hot shit got super hot ayy

Give me my respect Give me my respect

Prayed then I prayed again Amen Lord

Palace look like Buckingham

Bills so big I call 'em Williams for real

Reasons to go crazy got a trillion for real

They been tryin' me but I'm resilient for real

I can't go in public like civilian for real

And I hardly take offense

Money for revenge man that's hardly an expense

Al Haymon checks off of all of my events

I like all the profit man I hardly do percents I don't do that shit

A big part of me resents

Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit

They see what I got and man it's hard to be content

Fuck what they got goin' on I gotta represent Ayy



My head is spinnin' from smokin' the chicken the bass is kickin'

My head is spinnin' from smokin' the chicken the bass is kickin'

My head is spinnin'

This the flow that got the block hot shit got super hot





Ayy elevate elevate

Only obligation is to tell it straight

So much on my plate I gotta delegate

Baka passed a drug test we gotta celebrate

I'm in bed awake thinkin' how'd I make

All this happen for myself and my family

All this happen for myself and my family

There's no way that this is real man it can't be

Yeah yeah



If you need me you can call me I stay busy makin' money

You know what is on my mind all I think about is hunnids

I stay busy Bzz workin' on me

I stay busy with my business homie

I already hit her when you left her lonely

She is not the type that likes to take things slowly

Slowly my mouth is goin' off I don't know patience

I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious

I see the future when I get wavy Wavy God

But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne Haan when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion

I couldn't picture changes

When I was with Ms Creighton that lady hates me

Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton

I couldn't gauge it

I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan

He's playin' favourites it feels amazin' Yeah



Elevate elevate

Only obligation is to tell it straight

Me and all the guys found a better way

This a life bid we can never separate

I'm in bed awake thinkin' how'd I make

All this happen for myself and my family

All this happen for myself and my family

There's no way that this is real man it can't be



Yeah I can only tell you shit in pieces

As it happens to me I begin to write the thesis

Franny got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik

Vegas like Marineland that big whale treatment

Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend

I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'

My mood is changin' this summer I'ma be tweakin'





You've got me feeling emotions

Ayy higher

Ah

You've got me fe

You oh



Don't link me

Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song

Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along

I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone

And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on

I can't even capture the feeling I had at first

Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works

The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse

Their actions out of character even when they rehearse

Workin' in the land of the free the home of the brave

I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place

Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved

And they don't like that it's written all on they face

I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean

Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team

Iconic duos rip and split at the seams

Goodhearted people are takin' it to extremes

Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe

Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace

Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet

Leavin' me to ask is there anybody like me



You've got me fe

You ohhhh

You've got me fe

You ohhhh ayy



Missin' out on my years

There's times when I wish I was where I was

Back when I used to wish I was here

Missin' out on my days

Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise

Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways

I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade

Most times it's just somebody that's underaged

That's probably just alone and afraid

And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain

I always hear people complain about the place that they live

That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give

'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit

That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is

I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome

Then she finally got to Rome

And all she did was post pictures for people at home

'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known

I know another girl that's cryin' out for help

But her latest caption is Leave me alone

I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone

I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown

To post later and make it look like she still on the go

Look at the way we live

I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world

I was hidin' the world from my kid

From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate

Until you starin' at your seed you can never relate

Breakin' news in my life I don't run to the blogs

The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call

They always ask Why let the story run if it's false

You know a wise man once said nothin' at all

I'm exhausted and drained I can't even pretend

All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch

All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end

I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then



You've got me fe

You ohhhh ayy

Higher higher

You've got me fe

You ohhhh ayy

Higher higher





Yeah

I'm working on dying



I'm upset

Fifty thousand on my head it's disrespect

So offended that I had to double check

I'ma always take the money over sex

That's why they need me out the way what you expect



Got a lot of blood and it's cold

They keep tryna get me for my soul

Thankful for the women that I know

Can't go fiftyfifty with no ho

Every month

That shit is in a box to the left to the left Left left left



Got a lot of blood and it's cold

They keep tryna get me for my soul For my soul

We just right there up the road

You could hit it with a stone

I be out here on my own

I'm just tryna set the tone

I've been kicked when I was down

None of that shit matter now

Niggas think they run the town

'Til we run 'em out of town

And they gotta relocate

Gotta dip from where they stay

Everything will be okay

Man just stay up out my way



Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes

If I touch studio then we got one

I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know

But they can't take a joke 'cause it's not one

Think it's 'cause we live by the code reputation to uphold

Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from

I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke



Ayo blast that shit Maxx

Blast that shit back if you blastin'

Yeah yeah



Back and forth to Italy

My comment section killin' me

I swear I get so passionate

Y'all do not know the half of it

I grew up with the Reps Up boys we crashin' it and splashin' in

And when I say they crashin' it I do not mean a accident

I'm I'm still in the studio at 

And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived

And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride

You know when it comes to pride I can't put that shit aside

I've been kicked when I was down

None of that shit matter now

They be throwin' in the towel

I do yellow tail at TAO

They be watchin' what they say

Especially when it's to my face

Everything will be okay

Man just stay up out my way



Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes

If I touch studio then we got one

I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know

But they can't take a joke 'cause it's not one

Think it's 'cause we live by the code reputation to uphold

Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from

I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke





Yeah no more no more

Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby

Yeah no more no more

Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby

Ooh ooh Yeah



Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from

Price tags on makin' the world feel some

They don't have enough to satisfy a real one

Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done

Niggas scared to come towards us gotta run from us

Louisville hush money for my young gunners

Rick Pitino I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos

Stack of Cnotes get all you niggas scratched like Preemo

Worms I just opened up a can of those

My mother had a flower shop but I was Sandra's rose

Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones

I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose

Yeah fuck that I got to up the ante

California girls sweeter than pieces of candy

Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy

Type of hood where bandannas make niggas a family

Head on a swivel I could shoot but I could never dribble

Life too short I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle

My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals

But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues

I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell

Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele

Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell

I'm the chosen one flowers never pick themselves



Yeah no more no more

Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby yeah

Yeah no more no more

Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby

Ooh ooh



Niggas want a classic that's just ten of these

Crime family like the Genovese you don't want drama capisc'

My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid

I take this shit too serious you niggas my comic relief

I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase

I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach

I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets

Subtle reminders are key jeez

Spoiler alert the second act is tragic

And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened

Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards

Like Charlamagne I see the light and see the darkest patches

Bury me and I'll be born again

I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men

I got some real demons across the border fence

And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again

Like I said can of worms and I'm the early bird

Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work

Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the rd

When I say that they cursin' me it ain't dirty words

Church of Pentecost Holy Spirit synagogue

I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off

Sandra's rose no wonder they tryna pick me off

I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are



Yeah no more no more

Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby yeah

Yeah no more no more

Dopeman



Ten of us we movin' as one

I'm so proud of who I've become

You might think I've taken some lumps

Only if we talkin' 'bout sums Yeah

Intentions are pure they cannot tell me relax

My mentions are jokes but they never give me the facts

This isn't that can't be ignorin' the stats

Based off of that they gotta run me the max

They gotta run me the max they gotta double the racks

They had it set up for real but they didn't come with the slaps

When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that

If I get it trippin' it's no comin' back

I don't understand these niggas gotta adapt

You know where I'm at I put the  on the map

Your shorty was bent she wanted to vent

I promise it fell in my lap

My money is young my problems are old

I promise I'm bridgin' the gap



Woo You know what I'm sayin'

Woo Ayy ayy

Yeah you know what I'm sayin'

Gyeah gyeah gyeah gyeah



Niggas provoke this shit ain't a joke man nobody playin'

He's at the top and he's at the top but nobody stayin'

These niggas around but they ain't around

You know what I'm sayin'

Say that they down when they shit is down

You know what I'm sayin'



Yeah you know what I'm sayin'

Ayy ayy yeah

You know what I'm sayin'



Yo get close enough to HOV smell like a kilo still Still

First album  I ain't need no deal Real

Already a hood legend I ain't need no Shyne Woo

First Rollie flooded out I ain't see no time whoa

Standup niggas we only duckin' indictments

Dope boys OffWhite lookin' like soft white on 'em

Heh you know what I'm sayin'

We in the buildin' we came for a billion ain't nobody playin'

Live every word that I'm rappin'

Say I lost  bricks and it happened

You probably wouldn't believe

Everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action

I ain't on the 'Gram they record who I am

God to these dope boys how do you not be a HOV fan

I'm what Meech shoulda been

I'm what Supreme didn't become

If Alpo didn't snitch niggas'd be like Young

I got your President tweetin' I won't even meet with him

Y'all killed X and let Zimmerman live shh sstreets is done



You know what I'm sayin'

Ayy ayy yeah

You know what I'm sayin'

Gyeah gyeah gyeah gyeah



Niggas provoke this shit ain't a joke man nobody playin'

He's at the top and he's at the top but nobody stayin'

These niggas around but they ain't around

You know what I'm sayin'

Say that they down when they shit is down

You know what I'm sayin'



Yeah you know what I'm sayin'

Ayy ayy yeah

You know what I'm sayin'





Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain

Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon

Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest

Only problems I do are math problems with profit

Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics

Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it

Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses

Only rest that I do is Where the rest of my commas

Still I rise Maya Angelou vibes

When life comin' at you from all angles and sides

And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside

It really boils down to how you plan to survive

Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em

Give 'em nice things but what's that to 'em

Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom

And they recognize the bathroom

All hell starts to break loose in my texts

I only tell lies to who I gotta protect

I would rather have you remember me how we met

I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect

But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step

That ain't what I'm 'bout

I'm in control of my destiny never in doubt

If I can't make it with you I'll make it without

They say take the good with the bad I'll take it without

Houston women I wineanddine and take to the house

My moral compass is janky it breaks in the south



Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts

Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out

Is there more Yeah



Sweeter the berry the blacker the juice

The boy is back in the booth ready to tap into truth

Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot

Too many Walt Disney characters mouses and goofs

I mean you know I love a challenge but challenged by who

I'll let you bring a thousand recruits

My peers are a talented group

But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two

Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops

There's still nothin' they could really do

It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due

Whenever it's time to recoup

Yeah soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal

In the house playin' D'Angelo How Does It Feel

I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die

What you got Time on your hands or time on your side

Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high

Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai

Yachts on the th of July G soarin' the skies

Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties

And all of these fortunate times

And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size

Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find

Like healin' my soul like family time



Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive

Is there more



Passion instant

Sweat beads feel me feel me

Cupid's shot me

My heartbeat's racing my heartbeat's racing

Tempt me drive me tempt me

It feels so exciting

Thought of highly highly

It's yours entirely

I'll be I'll be more than a lover

More than a woman

More than a lover for you





Treat you like princess

Rest in heaven Diana

Piquing my interest

She got peak like Montana

England breeds proper girls

Where are all your good manners

Reply with pleasantries

Honestly I can't stand ya



Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh you gon' make me turn up on you

Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh you gon' make me turn up on you



What you thought of me

Never had me missin' a beat

That's just a view from a cheap seat

They don't want problems with me

Talk used to be cheap nowadays it's free

People are only as tough as their phone allows them to be

Girl that could never be me

I found my peace I'm about to say my piece

You might not agree with me



Bitch been with this boy yeah for four weeks

All of a sudden she married

Didn't say get bloodclaat married

What I'm sayin' in today really at our big big age if you're gettin' with someone right now and you're linking them for couple weeks they should know 'This is the girl I kinda want to see' so lemme lock off the ting but obviously in the world that we live in today is not like that

He is did thatbut obviously it takes timeyou're chattin' shit First of all you shouldn't have no problems at the beginning it should be like honeymoon

That's what I said that's what I said The beginning is always honeymoon season

You said I love you too fast

So much for that girl summer just started and we're already done



Yeah you say I led you on but you followed me

I follow one of your friends you unfollow me

Then you block them so they can't see you liking someone just like me

I expected more from you honestly

Said you want a simple life and that's not me

How you go from that to ending up with someone just like

How can you be angry on a night in July

And be warm with me when it's freezing outside

You're confusing me

Don't have me wasting my time

Yeah you said I love you too fast

So much for that girl summer just started and we're already done

I kept it decent I kept you sane

I kept it peaceful don't lie

I kept it decent even the secrets

Kept it between you and I

Breaking me down when I'm already down

Breaking my heart  breaking my heart  breaking my heart

Arch back heart attack cardiac

Keep it right there no moving

Make my way around the bases

I wanna take you to oasises

Bein' honest I don't really know what patience is

Ayy freaky like the red leather Michael

Zombie revival this ain't like you

This that new you this ain't high school high

I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation

Willing and ready for the taking

Earth shattering groundbreaking

Head scarf for after our relations

No judgment is our arrangement

Make that face up if you dare but just be prepared that

I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear

And the mascara tears to run down

I always need a glass of wine by sundown

I always get your ass over here somehow

I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now

Well what now



Did somebodywho'd they say that baby look like

Drake



Cashed out my neck is frozen

Careful when we're mixing potion

Slashin' like Guns N' Roses

You got options but I been chosen

To deal with you the way you like

The way you like it

To deal with you the way you like

The way you like it

Oh you

Cashed out my neck is frozen

Careful when we're mixing potion

Slashin' like Guns N' Roses

You got options but I been chosen

To deal with you the way you like

The way you like it yeah





Here we go yeah



Yesterday morning was crazy

I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe

That shit is in stone sealed and signed

She not my lover like Billie Jean but the kid is mine

Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time

And all it took was one time

Shit we only met two times two times

And both times were nothin' like the new times

Now it's rough times I'm out here on front lines

Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes

It's breakin' my spirit

Single father I hate when I hear it

I used to challenge my parents on every album

Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a coparent

Always promised the family unit

I wanted it to be different because I've been through it

But this is the harsh truth now

And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now

I don't want you worry 'bout whose house you live at

Or who loves you more or who's not there

Who did what to who 'fore you got here

Nah look I'm too proud

To let that come between me and you now

Realize I gotta think for two now

I gotta make it I better make it

I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated

This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated

I can't forget the looks on they faces

Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'

Tell Gelo bring some Mod Ros and the Baccarats out

For our cheers to the next generation

But this Champagne toast is shortlived

I got an empty crib in my empty crib

I only met you one time introduced you to Saint Nick

I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts

Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit

But man you know

I still had to get it for my boy though you know

You haven't met your grandfather yet that nigga a trip

He probably coulda did standup

Yeah but at the same time he's a stand up

And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up

October baby for irony's sake of course

I got this  tatted for somebody now it's yours

And believe me I can't wait to get a hundred more

Sorry I'm ventin' tryna cover ground

They said that in two weeks you're supposed to come in town

Hopefully by the time you hear this

Me and your mother will have come around

Instead of always cuttin' each other down

God willin' I got a good feelin'

You got a good spirit

We'll talk more when you hear this my G



I'm changing from boy to a man

No one to guide me I'm all alone

No one to cry on

I need shelter from the rain to ease the pain

Of changing from boy to a man

No one to guide me I'm all alone

No one to cry on

I need shelter from the rain to ease the pain

Of changing from boy to a man

I'm all alone

No one to cry on

I need shelter from the rain to ease the pain

Of changing from boy to a man

Here we go again





For my nigga Hush

Yeah look



Dressed in fatigues I rep the East with my trustees

Smokin' on crushed leaves

They turn they back on everything we built then they must bleed

I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze

Straps over territory they know we must keep

Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean

Back when my mama would interrupt sleep

To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves

Summertime heatwaves I used to just cut sleeves

My shorty really love me man she want me to cut keys

I can't do that normal type of life is it just me

Niggas steady try to ride the wave but it's rough seas

I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy

And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy

It's on Meech like it's trendy

Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty yeah

Early twenties but I want fifties hundreds not pennies

I need plenty

Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi

Whatever's in me it's takin' over

I gotta bust it down break it open

Until somebody starts takin' notice then we rollin'



Yeah then we rollin' then we rollin'

Deep pockets on a nigga I can't find my phone in

Now we rollin'

Yeah then we rollin' then we rollin'

Deep pockets on a nigga I can't find my phone in

Now we rollin'



Look

Back when Big Apple sold dreams I stuck to my own thing

Back when the house that I own now was my home screen

Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team

Runnin' missions

Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians

Back when hotlines were still flippin'

Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different

Transitions plans switchin' ambition

Mindin' my business buildin' a business et cetera

Inspired by a few but my mind really drives itself like Tesla

I always had a little somethin' extra

Back when Corey was our sole investor

And the car could get from A to B but won't impress ya

Look I ain't no baller

Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller

My soundtrack is the second Carter dreamin' of acceptin' offers

And easin' tensions

Keepin' family out of East Detention

And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center

Spots we got no business enterin'

Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye

I had to find a way to get someone's attention



Then we rollin' then we rollin'

Deep pockets on a nigga I can't find my phone in

Now we rollin'

Yeah then we rollin' then we rollin'

Deep pockets on a nigga I can't find my phone in

Now we rollin'





Yeah

Somebody um

Somebody hit me today and they were like

Nah just make sure you know

You tell me what to do when I get there you know

June you're a genius

I said I respect it no problem

I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway

Know what I'm sayin'

Yeah my hand's always open for real



Ayy

Thirtythree years I gave that to the game

Thirtythree mil' I'll save that for the rain

Five hundred weeks I'll fill the charts with my pain

Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the ix

Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist

Michael Jackson shit but the palace is not for kids

Still women sayin' it's childish the way we live

Brought a few Ws to the ix

Baby mama fluke but I love her for who she is

Baby Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit

Half the time I question my consciousness in this shit

Other times I question if compliments are legit

Fulltime I'm out here confident as a bitch

Tryna make good on the promises that I give

Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit

Register the business in my brother's name

Thirtyfive hunnid in her pocket that should cover things

Certified lover man trappin' out the motherland

Always move right so my watch is on the other hand

She can try and play it down now but she was a fan

People wanna know what's in my pockets they don't understand

My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands

Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans

Word to Sandra Graham no one love you like your mother can

I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands

I decide what to see next like it's on demand

I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans

I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman

I will split heads and break necks for my little man

 God prayin' hands like I'm a religious man

But I'm just a sicker man wicked man

Look we can argue back and forth but who's the richer man

Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in

Bang those dividends snakes stay slitherin'

How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in

How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in

How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again

How you gettin' hype off one hit Do that shit again

How you got a manager you mad at after you got the win

Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end

Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends

Give 'em a percentage see what happens to your blessings then

You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been

There when others should've been

Got a nigga starin' at the game like Damn coach put him in

But you never listen so you niggas goin' wood again

Got us in the crib talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been shoulda been

And I got your girl on the second floor beggin' me to put it in

And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend

And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge

It's because you niggas insecure you ain't made men

It's because even though you hate on me we stay friends

It's because you niggas never learn when to say when

Yeah



For real

Facts you know what I'm sayin'

Hahaha yeah

Just came up now so

Anybody feel any way about it I don't give a fuck

Yeah family



Yeah

Yeah

Lost you to the game I gotta hug that

I was here when you was asking where the love at

Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back

I was wishin' on a star when I was that

I've been fortunate enough to have it my way

I'm a fortune teller listen to what I say

'Member when we used to park up in my driveway

I always told it how it was I never shy away

This life is really something you get lost in

I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends

I had friends that only had half of they heart in

It's hard to accept now and it was hard then

But I treated you like gold I was all in

Spoiled rotten they could smell you 'fore you walked in

Burnin' incense in your new apartment

But you got no sense when it come to

Lost you to the game I gotta hold that

How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that

I'll be better off without you and we know that

You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back

Like I'm tryna show the waves this is no cap

You sold me up the river but I rowed back

You put me on the road without a roadmap

I'm not tryna make no song these are cold facts



You got some liquor at the house

Yeah

Go get a shot let's do a shot together

I don't see it

Okay ha ha ha



Ay

Being here wasn't in the plans

I do it for the Grahams not the 'Gram

I do it for the fam but still fuckin' Uncle Sam

I tried to change for you but that wasn't who I am

Even when being real is out of fashion

Niggas keep stealin' my style now we out here matchin'

I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting

I couldn't sit around and wait I had to have it happen

Lost you to the game I gotta face that

Really think I lost you like a ways back

Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair

I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there

You was supposed to grow some wings get your own pair

We started this from the bottom now you alone there

Shit you treat it like it's home there

Dependent on me you was supposed to get your own share

I still love you to my last days

I never knew that shit would be this fastpaced

I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case

I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face

It could've went left on a couple bad days

When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place

See me these days I never got on a sad face

See me these days I

Lost you to the game and I see why

It was always you and I without the TY

This is not one of them stories that got three sides

This is not one of them stories you could rewind

Like I'm tryna show the waves this is no cap

You drove a nigga crazy but I drove back

You wrote me off and then you never wrote back

I'm not tryna make no song these are cold facts



Yes sir

Baby

Hold on hold on

Let me tell you something about me

I really do know I know who I wanna be

Woo

Lord I already passed on all that Woo

You go 'head on ha ha

I don't cop things for resale don't do iCloud don't do email

Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail

Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale I was doin' dinner with Teezy

I didn't trust no one swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy

Niko never move neeky sweatsuit Nike sweatsuit DG

If man get beaky ring ring call up GiGi do him up neatly

Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat

Thought he was a bad boy then 'til man got pinched and man went PC

Man went PC just like Dell and Windows some man been those

Before I was ever around Kendall's I was at ends though dreamin' up Enzos

The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie

Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy

Word to the broski Jay he got different names in different countries

Three waps in the whip and we beat that case where man live way too comfy

I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats

Woioi man got flown like private jets for way way less

I know you tried to get one down on us ever since then it's been stress

'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts

Wassa wassa just like the crodie Pressa I don't do no passa

Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza

Pasha Sasha pissed I was way too young at the time for slashings

You niggas spend too much time on captions not enough time on action

Pick one man with slaps that's rappin' I bet he don't want no clashings

The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion niggas just actin'

Are you dumb or stupid The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz headshot domazz

Just checked in at a hotel floor that we on got potent aromas

OVOXO link up mandem drink up me and the drillers

Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka Gucci P and Gilla

And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller you know that's been my nigga

Yeah we just had to fix things family ix tings we can't split up

As for the rest of the game I'll do man dirty man'll get two time

To me that's just our side I don't really care who rides on whose side

Bring ten shots to the poolside never seen none of these grown men outside

 won't spare no one niggas gotta know about Southside

Steppin' outta line get outlined and you know I'm tied up stateside

Bringin' man down when they take sides tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside

Prince I carry that last name that shit stays on me like brand names

Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting

Everyone I know has code names anyone I'm beefin' with is a noname

Niggas can't even win home games they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train

I love you I love you I love you

Until I until I

I love you I love you I love you

Until I find the

They the only words I know

That you



I been hot since the birth of my son

I remain unfazed trust worse has been done

Man fuck a valuation show me personal funds

It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys

Sold that already got a whole new set of toys

Shit is so surreal Drizzy Drake you better enjoy

Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys

Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides

Ollie got the first edition parked up roadside

The only sign of strugglin' is coming from those guys

I'm trying to just relate what I can see through my own eyes

And nothin' tell the truth like the eyes will

Lived so much for others don't remember how I feel

Friends that hide places and friends that I hide still

Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield

And then I'll come back to tell you how that feels

Built this house for us all pain in my back still

You niggas gassed up you couldn't pay the



I love you I love you I love you

Until I until I

I love you I love you I love you

Until I find the

They the only words I know

That you



Champagne poetry these are the effortless flows

Supposedly something else is controlling me

Under her picture lives some of the greatest quotes from me

Under me I see all the people that claim they over me

And above me I see nobody

I'd have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me

The twenty percent of you that we own is my tootsie's money

Nigga I'm wilding with your bread you owe it to me

CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me

They don't want a problem with the boy but it's goin' to be

Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be

Future sign the contracts he don't even show it to me

I don't have to secondguess nothing with no one I love

'Bout to build a second guest house 'cause we growing too much

Thing I got to scale the love back 'cause



I need you I need you I need you

I need to make you see

What you mean to me

Until I do I'm hoping you will know what I mean



I need to make you see Yeah

What you mean to me Oh

I love you I love you I love you Heavy day

For real

Oh I cried and I cried

Yeah

Until I found the Lord

I need to make you see Yeah



The city's on fire and people are in denial

Charges being laid but we'll see what they do with trial

I'm calling this shit from now

Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down

I haven't been able to see family for a while

That shit is wearin' me out

I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out

And if money's all I need in my grave then bury me now

I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me

But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me

Man I can't even RIP and show my remorse to the homie

Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me

I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me

My parents divorce is on me

My therapist's voice is making the choices for me

And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what they reporting on me

The pressure is weighin' on me

Career is going great but now the rest of me is fading slowly

My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me

My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly

My heart feel vacant and lonely but still

I'm makin' the most of this shit and more

Every single move is like rolling dice on the board

Seen too many brothers get twentyfive from the boys

I'd rather see all of 'em get twentyfive from the Lord

And if the last negotiation made you pay me twentyfive

Well this is the perfect time to give me twentyfive more

I'm bigger now than before

Coparent of the year we figured out a rapport

No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour

How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed

How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards

How the  do we manage to win everything but awards

Windows of opportunity let me go through the doors

This the part where I don't ever say Pardon me anymore

This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore

This the part where all my partners know what we in it for

This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war

And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket

Well this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure

You owe that shit to the boy yeah

I need to make you see



I love you I love you I love you

What you mean to me

I need to make you see

What you mean to me

What you mean to me

What you mean to me

Yeah Go Squad

Ayy

Look



I wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from me

The first second they speak to me I'm not with all the secrecy

Secretly beefin' me behind closed doors

But playin' it peacefully for the streets to see

My nigga have some decency

Don't move like a puto

Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo

I made north of the border like Vito Rizzuto

Throwin' parties in Miami they lovin' us mucho

With the ho ratio I'm like David Caruso

There's a mad shortage of people givin' me kudos

I been doin' this since TPain was pourin' us Nuvo

You tell 'em I run the country they'll say True though

Papi chulo grippin' culo

And I got the flows niggas steal like boot toes

You boys reachin' new lows

Lettin' me take the rap for that Casper the Ghost shit

While you findin' all of the loopholes

You niggas move too cold

See the watch collection and assume I got time

'Cause of the ruby rose twotone

Or switch it to the one I call RIP Nipsey

'Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stones

Maybe I'm gettin' too stoned

Calacatta marble for my tombstone

Here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song

Or any of his old songs

They sing them shits like folk songs

Kumbaya boombaye

Know the owl stay on me

Bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me

Tryna get the earl grey on me

But I ain't really into talkin' names

Only tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shame

Heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame

High fashion and my life is full of climaxes

And my wishes come true without blowin' eyelashes

Up in 'Bron crib fishbowl wineglasses

That's how we passin' time

Hundred thousand on the line

At the table prayin' banker shows a natural nine

It never happens half the time

My losing nights are still a vibe

That's the things I accept

You over there in denial we not neck and neck

It's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correct

Man fuck a Respectfully I just want my respect

They tried to label me mean I say what I mean

People that could've stayed on the team

They played inbetween

Clouds is hanging over you now 'cause I'm reigning supreme

Some of these niggas say what they mean it ain't what it seems

Had to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines

You niggas hot to them little kids you ain't famous to me

Told you I'm aimin' straight for the head not aiming to please

I could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees

Have somebody put you on a Gildan you play with my seed

Trust me there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe

That's why your people not believers they all leavin' ya

That's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya

You know the fourth level of jealousy is called media

Isn't that an ironic revelation

Give that address to your driver make it your destination

'Stead of just a post out of desperation

This me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation

While you over there tryna impress the nation

Mind's runnin' wild with the speculation

Why the fuck we peacemakin' doin' the explanations

If we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation

But let me digress on behalf of the association

I'll play it cool with you Denmark a nigga like Copenhagen

See they gettin' loose with the line like open cages

In the La Ferrari my emotions racin' dancin' out a condo ocean bathin'

Niggas textin' Bro but we are not of no close relation

I was down to give these niggas credit but hold the payment

Somehow I'm the greatest in the game to my own amazement

The greatest in the world there's no debatin'

You boys 'bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin'

Far as the Drake era man we in the golden ages

Look at the total wages

And look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older ages

If we talkin' top three then you been slidin' to third like stolen bases

Toss around Rollies with the frozen faces

They used to tell me back in the day Boy you're going places

Never understood where I could really take it



Yeah





Uh

This might be too real too real



Hold me closer in these

Trying times supposed to be mine

Baby

I need some help just like anyone else

Hold me closer in these

Trying times open your eyes

Baby

You said you felt something for me Talk to 'em

I don't know when

Based on the signals you send

Based on the way you apologized

When you came to see me and then Then what

You had the nerve to defend Defend what

Mistakes that you made at the end

You said I was too invested

And that's what had forced you to go and pretend

I swear you crazy

Someone that's close to you reached out to me just to see if we had made amends Oh



Trust me this ain't 'bout revenge

But now I get along better with your friend Woo

And it's wrong I know Know know know

But again Ooh yeah

Trust me this ain't 'bout revenge

I get along better with your friend Oh

And it's wrong I know it's wrong I know oh



No

You said you felt you said you felt

Something that's different from everyone else

You had the nerve to still ask for my help

Dug you out ditches you buried yourself ahoh

You said you fell

And I took your word that night in our hotel

One thing about time surely time's gonna tell

Never had to work for much so you said it yourself ahoh oh

Can't let it go can't get this out of me

This shit still bothers me

Don't you dare Don't you dare

Don't say you're proud of me

Hurt's just unreal to me

Now you wanna come cry to me Cry cry

Three whole years after me

Why did you wait 'til the end

Trust me this ain't 'bout revenge

I get along better with your friend

Oh and it's wrong I know but again

No I'm never gangbangin' in my blue Chucks

Money callin' so I threw the deuce up

Yeah they plottin' on me but they gotta do somethin'

Told my dawg twosomethin' just to shoot somethin'

Left them niggas stretched out on the train tracks

Rather you than me here come that payback

Got 'em lookin' for that paper that they can't tax

Yayo so clean I told 'em call it Ajax

Hialeah celebrated when Fidel died

Patti LaBelle who knew that we would sell pies

Standin' on your own is when you realize

When all the lights go out that's when you see the real guys

Back to the real niggas glowin' in the dark

Never perfect but you know a nigga heart

A rich nigga that'll pull up to the park

Get on one knee and tell the kids that they are stars

Bullet wounds don't be covered by ObamaCare

Your funeral was way too soon that's if your mama there

Real niggas deserve to live twice

Plastic fork and some fried rice





Yeah twopointtwo for the Rafael Nadal

Don't act like you're happy for me now

Don't act like you wasn't prayin' for catastrophic collapses

Catalog is immaculate

Still runnin' the game don't ask me about the practice

Ho you go on vacation don't ask me about relaxin'

Not sure if you know but I'm actually Michael Jackson

The man I see in the mirror is actually goin' platinum

Unthinkable when I think of the way these niggas been actin'

Yeah I never did you nothin' and you play like we family huh

Next thing you wanna shoot me down it can't be love

Not sure where you was tryna send it it can't be up

That day you sounded like a bitch you fancy huh

Damn how can I forgive like this

I gotta dead a lot of shit just to live like this

I had to fuck a lot of girls to get a kid like this

I had to get a lot of cribs to get a crib like this nigga

That's why I'm movin' all elusive

These boys on they last resort and it's givin' us all inclusive

Been spazzin' since CB was chunkin' up the deuces nigga

Your shit was booboo excuses excuses nigga





Brrrt may I speak to pussy niggas

I got women in the Phantom with they cleavage out the window

Long hair lot of tats and I smell like the pack

Money trail right on track

Whip that big body Maybach like it's a little Pontiac

All my chains look like snakes that's some real diamondbacks

Pull my hammer out her pussy pull her nails out my back

And on this Codeine I'm a turtle it done shellshocked my ass

Pill popped house in Hidden Hills on the hilltop

Truly findin' yourself

Gettin' more

We should really be together more

But I'm never sure





I'm still working on me

And I'm coming back better for you I'm comin' back ohooh

Most times it was my selfishness and your helplessness that I took advantage of

You sit in the house and I be out and I know why you're worried uh I know you're worried you're worried you're worried

And you try and block it out

I'm so sorry for letting you down Ohoh ohah



I should've came home came home sooner

You'd probably still be there if I

Came home love you like I treat ya

You'd still be there

My girl my lil' baby speechless

You'd still be there baby



I'm still working on me Work it

And I'm coming back with a plan and there's money in my hand baby Work it

You said I was fucking up when I was out here fucking fans damn and it made you look crazy

Made you seem made you feel it was crazy Oohah

While you sit in the house I be out and you stay worried about me Oh



Ayy yeah

Nights when I just needed to hold somebody

Feeling overwhelmed should've told somebody

Picture and it's me sending chills through your body

I just probably should've chilled 'til I saw you

How am I supposed to get to know somebody

Nigga left his s and I still wanna party

I can not be trusted on my own with nobody

I can not be

If we broke it off then you know it wasn't painless

If she got a watch then you know it's not a stainless

I was out here fucking fans I was shameless

Yeah and I know that

You was at the crib reading stories that they sent you

Most of that was bullshit but some of it I did do

Hard for me to justify the women I was into

Especially when the whole entire world wished they had you

Then I locked the door that night in Vegas 'cause I had to

Then I had a kid even though I never planned to

I cannot imagine when your girls gave you that news

I know that

Probably made you want to hit the streets on everything

Probably made you want to pour bleach on everything

Probably made you want to kill me on everything

Yeah trust I know that Trust I know

Dialing I'ma say two zero one four

'Cause you're on the same shit that you was on before

I know you're not happy girl everybody know

Could see it in your boyfriend eyes at the show

Don't tell me let it go I'm a letting go pro

You don't wanna grow but we gotta outgrow

Went six digits on the lock screen code

You're bragging to that ho and it's gon' be a lot of smoke

We both getting rich but the trust getting broke

Tear me down with words but I know that's how you cope

Cover up a lot can't cover up your soul

Know you're not happy girl everybody know



Trust I know that trust I know





Yeah look



Me and Lil Sandra bagging CDs in the bubble wrap

People recognize me from the TV but I'm done with that

People don't want to see me succeed this shit come with that

Even when I come back I don't know if it's me that's gonna be coming back

Soon as I left I had to make peace with that

Dropped out of school cause nobody was teaching that

The best Western is where a nigga was sleeping at

Daemen College booking me to pull up and speak the facts

Even if they make a movie bout' us this shit'll be hard to reenact

Dislocated shoulder it's hard to be always reaching back

All these I owe yous it's hard for me to be keeping track

Friends who've dedicated their life to just keeping me in tact

Hard to pay  pay Noel pay Niko back

All the nights I needed to vent to someone at CJ's set

All the nights Chubbs was pulling up where I need him at

All the times Mark was making sure that my luggage packed and times he had to double back

I mean even with a salary you can't put no prices on that there is no salary cap there is no paying em back for real

I wonder what it could've been if I had snakes in the mix

Actually I never want to know because we made it like this

Shots got to fly either way now make it or miss

Overtime I was all good we take it in shifts

What would you do if it wasn't this that's a hard one

The finish line is where I like to pull up and start from

Pain is just a place that I go and get the bars from

Anxiety's a drug that I use to get the job done

Delusional is a space I like to think that I'm far from

My son is the one thing I hate to be apart from

Bet against me don't know where they're getting the odds from

I know that when it's done I'm going wherever God's from

But I still don't know where I get the calm from

Yeah



Yeah look

Got to hold my head high with two dry eyes

I told you everything is fine dog but I lied

I be trying to draw the line but it's a fine line

And I'm drowning out the noise from the sideline

Sometimes it's louder than the voice I got in my mind

I can't even hear myself when I get quiet time

Like how they telling me I'm done when I'm in my prime

They've been trying to push the narrative since '

And they've even had my ass convinced a couple times

But that ain't even the half I've had tougher times

Only look for sympathy inside my mothers eyes

And it's whatever with them niggas on the other side

We got problems we could never really put aside

I cracked the door for us all put my foot inside

I tried to kill them boys with kindness but they wouldn't die

So now I Kill 'Em All for acting like they couldn't die yeah



My hard work doesn't just pay off it pays all the family debts off I'm taking heads off Future out here like Irving Azoff

House is paid off label paid off my soul for the money wasn't the trade off

Unlike most of you boys that fade off

I feel guilty taking some days off

Please don't Google my net worth the numbers are way off

I mean if you comparing it to what I really made off with

I'm more like Bernie with all the earnings that they came off

Trust me it was nothing light homes

They tried to give me a slice of the pie and I took the knife home

I know you love me can't picture being a hubby fingers too stubby to fit a ring on unless Kawhi want to run it back

Other than that the strings will be unattached

Certified Lover Boy I'm not the one for cuddling or none of that y'all music is watered down will you love em back

And you know what I'm on blowing past you owning masters

Said you're like a father figure to me but now daddy's not around so I'm a bastard

Oh of course the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more

Soft spot for all of the ones that came before I can't ignore it

I'm always trying to rekindle from the bottom to the top man what's it like in the middle

From the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter

To my dogs in the game who wasn't pickett or litter

For the youngest out here starting from the beginning

Nobody praying for you when you winning don't forget it



Woah woah woahwoah

Woah woah

Woah woahwoah woah

Woah woah ah

Said it's hard when it starts to fade away

Said it's hard when it starts to fade away

Yeah Ooh yeah

Said it's hard when it starts to fade away

Her stomach is flat as fuck

Meet Thomazzo and Ernesto

Short rigatoni with the pesto

These verses are my manifesto

Hallways got an echo

Me and Smigs on the loose in the city you know how the rest go

Casual sex I'm like Fuck a dress code

The first martini is an espresso

Chill shot glasses with prosecco

Niggas so ignorant in our hood they be like Why the fuck you makin' techno

I'm worldwide and this is just another cargo jet flow I had to let go

Life insurance policies you niggas 'bout to need the gecko

Swedish jail cell smellin' like some Carby Musk

For your birthday your boyfriend got a party bus

Bottle signs club lines should've come with us

I'm here for the moral support

Whippin' the Vespa off of six tequilas

Big Benjamins like the Pittsburgh Steelers

Drake you got it

Robert Kraft sent the jet for us that shit was patriotic

You would think we live in Baltimore the way they ravin' 'bout the latest product

Teachin' niggas how to mind they business and my latest stuff

That's why I'm in Hyde Park buyin' like half of Harrods

You niggas are too concerned with makin' sure y'all outfits gon' match in Paris

If we don't like you you payin' tax and tariffs

Come to the  and I'm like the actin' sheriff deputy

First got to America niggas wouldn't check for me

No chance the kid'll make it here like vasectomy

They underestimated my trajectory

But now they gotta pay that shit direct to me

I send the label bills bills bills like the other two women standing next to Bey that shit was just

Independent women is lovin' the new appearance

Matter of time before I go net a Bey like a Paris

Like Honey you gotta know that I never wore Mike Amiris or never hopped in a Urus

I got my head in the clouds I'm serious

The lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods

Promise you'll get that shit when the sky clears

This shit designed for divine ears

My favorite two words from you white boys is Sign here

And then comes the sound of glass clinkin' from a wine cheers

Swear I'm pocket checkin' y'all for five years

Takin' less L's makin' more M's

Put her Skims on now she actin' like she Kim

Take it to the paint take it to the rim

You look good on camera baby let's go make a film



Big diamonds Big Puns VS's

Long guns home runs I'm the don

I can hang in the trenches with no one

Plenty switches with extensions it's no fun

Givin' out spankings

Ridin' with lil' 'cause he shoot without thinkin'

Baptize a nigga send him home in a blanket

Upgrade a bitch and put some diamonds in her anklet

Better not get no throw up on my seat I know you drinkin'

You ain't fuck no rapper you a dinosaur you ancient

I like fried rice you better cook like you an Asian

Wrote a lot of verses but I never wrote no statement

I been in them rooms I never did no contemplatin'

This bitch wanna argue I ain't doin' no debatin'

Seen her with her nigga waved my hand I'm like Hey friend

Lookin' at the Shade Room that shit be entertainin'

Tryna turn an opp into a motherfuckin' painting

Wells Fargo where I'm banking nigga

Heard your album sales tankin' nigga

My bros down the road shank you nigga



Strike like a match knock him out his hat

Knife to a gun fight this ain't none of that

Had to cut her off she got too attached

Dissin' on his album and it flopped he deserved it

Come up out that booth and bring that energy in person

Got so many hits it wouldn't be fair to do no verses

I could really go five hours in the stadium

What happened to that nigga claiming OVO We traded him

Thought I was a popstar I'm Slaughter Gang I baited 'em

Walk around like Prince 'cause I got a lot of lady friends

Used to be in 'Sauga out at Sega City Playdium

Skatin' through this album like a Montreal Canadien

Way that I ran shit you'd think I was Iranian

Niggas see my deal look at they deal and now they hate the kid

Fuck let me kick it basic

Niggas ain't got love for the boy so they fake it

Crack a couple jokes to some bitches on some snake shit

But if I send a verse to they ass then they'll take it

Shoot a video arm around me like we aces

Probably why these hoes love to shower me with praises

Metro

Metro in this bitch goin' brazy



You said fuck me and I was like Cool

So now what's the problem



Don't go hiding again

Tired of asking where you been

You left so abruptly

I guess it's fuck me

Tell me what did I do wrong

Tell me what did I do wrong

Tell me what did I do wrong

Tell me what did I do wrong

Before it's over

I need you to come over once again

And before you give me closure

Need you to come a little bit closer



Still steppin' like Omega Psi Phi for mine

If bein' real was a crime I'd be doin' life

Like that nigga not nice I don't know polite

I'm the first ever antisocial socialite

The pain that I seen in my mother's eyes in 

Have me workin' 'til it's 

And get hate when I tell you Oh some other time

Like I really got some other time

You just tell me Never mind

Know I sound crazy to a lazy mind

Know it'll be a different kind

Shout out to the people workin' nine to five

I be workin' nine to nine

And the six upside down it's a nine

You already know the vibe

And they leave 'cause of pride but they comin' back every time

The devils that I recognize most of them got pretty eyes

Titties and some plans of just gettin' by that's the way they live or die

Easy to judge but girl who am I

Truth or dare I'ma take a double dare

Truth is a suicide

I would rather live a lie keep you on the outside

Introduce you to the guys

Have you throwin' up the south side like you're one of mine

But you're not one of mine

You belong to everybody else when you're bored in your free time

Shit could make a thug cry play it like a tough guy

Couldn't even land in the Hamptons they didn't have the stairs for the shit I fly

Swear it's like a metaphor I can't even get down from the shit I climb

Can't even get down from the shit I climb

Yeah girl you're my size

Make me tell you one time

We was on the front line shit was in my bloodline

Waitin' for the sunshine

But the sun never shines on me on me

Sleepin' in the whip sometimes girl I was sleepin' upright

Henny red cup life broski kept it tucked tight

Niggas talkin' bad shit about what they gon' do to mine

Aw now their tongues tied

We was smokin' watched the sun climb

I would trap until my thumbs cried

Tryna change it all in one line

Never seen a thug cry

Love it's been a long time

Bet you never seen a thug cry

Hit me on my hotline

And no ma I'm not fine at all



Don't go hiding again

Tired of asking where you been

You left so abruptly

I guess it's fuck me

Tell me what did I do wrong

Tell me what did I do wrong

Tell me what did I do wrong

Tell me what did I do wrong

Before it's over

I need you to come over once again

And before you give me closure

Need you to come a little bit closer
